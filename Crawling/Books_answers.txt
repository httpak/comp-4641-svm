It should be noted, however, that Daniel 11:31-35 and 12:9, 11 connect a \u2018disgusting thing causing desolation\u2019 with \u201cthe time of the end.\u201d It is reasonable that the development of this latter expression of \u2018the disgusting thing causing desolation\u2019 in the time of the end should follow the general pattern of that in the first century C.E., though not being restricted to the land of Israel.\nJerusalem\u2019s desolation in 70 C.E. brought the end of the \u201choly place,\u201d Jerusalem, \u201cthe holy city.\u201d (Mt 27:53) However, the Scriptures direct our attention to a \u201cheavenly Jerusalem,\u201d the Messianic Kingdom, which is represented on earth by anointed Christians. (Heb 12:22) There are also others that falsely claim to represent that Kingdom, and Revelation chapter 17 shows that their religious field of operations will be desolated by the \u201cten horns\u201d (kings) of a symbolic \u201cwild beast.\u201d\nDisgusting Things of Babylon the Great. In the prophetic vision of Revelation 17, the symbolic immoral woman, Babylon the Great, is depicted.

In the middle of the \u2019seven' he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on a wing [of the temple] he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.\u201d\nIn 167 B.C. a Greek ruler by the name of Antiochus\nset up an altar to Zeus over the altar of burnt offerings in the Jewish temple in Jerusalem. He also sacrificed a pig on the altar in the Temple in Jerusalem. This event is known as the abomination of desolation.\nAnother abomination of desolation would occur in a Jewish temple, The Antichrist will do something very similar to what Antiochus Epiphanies did.\nRead what Daniel prophesied in Daniel 9:27 Antiochus did not confirm a covenant with Israel for seven years. It is the Antichrist who, in the end times, will establish a covenant with Israel for seven years and then break it by doing something similar to the abomination of desolation in the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.", "It's when, at some point in the future, in the third temple, that a man, known in Christianity as the antichrist will stand in the temple and declare himself as god and make a sacrifice unto his father, satan.\nThis will happen half way or at the midpoint of the Seven year tribulation period.\nIt must be noted that Israel as a nation, make a pact or deal with this political leader. This would have happened three and half years previously to the mid point. In absolutely no way does Israel see this man as the Messiah, just a gentile who promises a deal of political security, which he then breaks.\nDaniel ch 9.", "It had a minor fulfillment in the first century when, in 67 CE (AD) the Roman army breached the walls of the Temple in Jerusalem. Then three years later they destroyed Jerusalem and it\u2019s Temple. However, it was to to have a greater fulfillment when Jesus said there would be a great tribulation with would be greater than anything before and would never occur again. There have obviously been greater times of tribulation than the Small scale, limited destruction, of the city of Jerusalem in the first century.\nIn the greater fulfillment the abomination causing desolation began as the League of Nations, which came as formed after World War II. It was embraced by the Churches of Christendom as the organization to bring peace and security to the earth, thus it stood in a holy place which only God\u2019s Kingdom can rightly occupy. After it failed, the United Nation Organization replace it and it now is the abomination bring desolation.", "What is the Abomination of Desolation spoken of by Daniel in the Bible?\nIf you can no discern the fulfillment of this Abomination of Desolation in the New Testament of Jesus , what good too your Spiritual growth is it.\nFind the equivlant passages in the New testament and you will have found a new treasure in Heaven.", "My perspective is that \u201cthe abomination that causes desolation\u201d is borrowed in the New Testament from Daniel 9:27. Many refer it to an alleged coming of Antichrist to the (rebuilt) temple in the last days of the world. But coming at your question from a New Testament perspective (the New is in the Old concealed, the Old is in the New revealed) is to wrench the whole idea out of its context (see Matthew 24:15\u201320).\nI will get to Daniel 9:27 later, but, Luke interpreting for Gentiles, gives us some help. He records the words as \u201cWhen you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near\u201d (Luke 21:20). There, as in Matthew 24:15\u201320, this is the signal for \u201cthose who are in Judea\u201d to \u201cflee to the mountains\u201d. Whether \u201cthe holy place\u201d refers to Jerusalem or to the temple itself does not matter. So, in answer to your question \u2014 What we have here from a New Testament perspective is the Roman armies invading the land, bearing their sacrilegious banners, or eagles, to defile the holy place.\nIt is worthy of note that Jesus expects these events to be seen and clearly understood \u2014 signs which may be acted upon. This is completely different from the prophecies concerning his Second Coming, given later in Matthew 24. In that instance there is no warning; there are no signs. Always there is surprise. Here, in Matthew 24:15\u201320 we have signs which the Christian can observe and from which they can take warning.\nThe historical record is not clear, but there is what Carson calls \u201creasonably good tradition that Christians abandoned the city, perhaps in A.D. 68, about half-way through the siege\u201d and took refuge in the mountains. Jesus then gives detailed instructions \u2014 instructions which could not be followed in time, if the return of Christ was in the picture.\nI see these actions belonging to Palestine and indicate that these verses (Matthew 24:15\u201320) belong to this period before A.D. 70. It was in Palestine that men would be on the roof of their houses and needed to be warned \u201cnot to go down to take anything out of the house\u201d. Those in the field are warned not to go back to get their cloaks. \u201cPregnant women and nursing mothers\u201d would suffer in such circumstances.\nMost clearly, we read, \u201cPray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath\u201d. The reference to the Sabbath, especially, demands the context of first-century Palestine. If they fled on the Sabbath, they would find no help from Jews, eager to keep the Sabbath and unwilling to help those in need.\nAs far as the Old Testament (Daniel 9:27) is concerned. Daniel is seeing this in the sixth century B.C. but it did not happen until A.D. 70 when Titus and his Roman legions fulfilled this prophecy exactly. The destruction of Jerusalem did not immediately follow Calvary, but it was an event which was determined by the fact that the Jews rejected Christ. It did not happen in the seventieth \u2018week\u2019 , but was determined in the seventieth \u2018week\u2019. Jesus made it clear, both in His Olivet discourse and as He walked to the cross, that his rejection by the Jews would mean the destruction of their city and temple (Matthew 23:34 \u2014 24:38 ; Luke 23:27\u201431).\nWe might be helped here, by thinking back to Adam. He was told that he would die on the very day that he ate the forbidden fruit. But he did not literally drop down dead. That day he died spiritually, and his physical death followed as a certain result. In the same way, Jerusalem\u2019s destruction was made certain by the Jewish rejection of their Messiah, but it was some little time before the event occurred. It did not take place in the seventieth \u2018week\u2019, but was most surely part and parcel of the events of that \u2018week\u2019.\nWhat else is prophesied in Daniel concerning that final \u2018week\u2019 ?\n\u201cAnd he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week\u201d (9:27). This is what Jesus did in announcing \u201cThis is my blood of the new covenant (testament), which is shed for many for the remission of sins (Matthew 26:28).\n\u201cAnd in the midst of the week, he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease\u201d (Daniel 9:27). Jesus did this too, because he was sacrificed once for all (see Hebrews 7:27). The veil of the temple was torn in two, and the way into the Holiest was permanently opened by his never-to-be-repeated sacrifice. There was no further need for the Old Testament rituals and oblations. In fact, the destruction of Jerusalem made it impossible, eventually, for them to be continued.", "The abomination of desolation is first described briefly by Daniel in chapter 12, then Matthew 24 by Jesus, and also in Revelation 13. You would think it was made note of enough times that it would be taken seriously, yet there are those who say it all took place by 70 A.D. when the temple was destroyed. How anyone makes a connection like this is beyond me. No individual is identified by them matching either the first or second beast of Revelation 13. The temple is not destroyed but exists in Revelation 13. Revelation was written in the time of Domitian, late 1st century, according to 2nd century attestation of Irenaeus, a little late for preterist views. The abomination of desolation is an image made by the second beast (antichrist 2) to honor the first beast (antichrist 1), an idol. It speaks. All this is technologically possible today. So the question is, is it done technologically or supernaturally? That\u2019s TBA. Its location by Matthew 24:15 is the temple. It is set up 1,290 days into week 70 of Daniel, (see Daniel 12:11). This is 30 days past the middle of the week when the antichrist cuts of the daily sacrifice of the Jews.", "Daniel mentions two of such, (Daniel 9:27; 11:31) and in both cases they seem to be connected to the end of a world.\nTherefore, when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation, as spoken about by Daniel the prophet, standing in a holy place (let the reader use discernment), . . . then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world's beginning\nMatthew 24:15, 21\nThis was fulfilled when the armies of a Gentile nation\u2014an abomination to the Jews\u2014came to desolate Jerusalem and her temple, putting a violent end to the organised system of worship that has been practiced there for centuries. (Daniel 9:27; Luke 21:20, 23)\nHowever, notice that Matthew 24:15 ends with the words \u201clet the user use discernment,\u201d and that's because this appears to be a dual prophecy, since another abomination of desolation occurs in Daniel 11:31. Like Daniel 9:27, the abomination of desolation spoken of in Daniel 11:31 will cause desolation to many organised forms of worship that is being practiced on earth today.\nAt this point, it is necessary to consider how Revelation expounds on this thought, since, as you might know, Revelation and Daniel are complementary books of prophecy.\nRevelation 17:3, 16 brings two entities into play, a wild beast, an abomination in itself, \u201cfull of blasphemous names,\u201d that turns against a woman and completely destroys her, leaving her utterly desolate. Happily, God himself helps us unravel these mysteries.\u2014Revelation 17:7.\nIn Revelation 17:11-13, the wild beast is called a \u201cking,\u201d or a dominant political agency in the world scene, an agency that \u201cten kings,\u201d i.e, all the political forces, subscribe to. (cf. Daniel 1:20; Revelation 2:10) And this political agency had a predecessor, but it re-emerged a stronger version of itself. (Revelation 17:8) The only agency that fits this description is the League of Nations and it's successor, the United Nations.\nChristendom hailed this organization as mankind's only hope for peace and security, the political expression of God's Kingdom on earth, and the UN went along with it, thus becoming blasphemous by setting itself as counterfeit \u201cKingdom of God,\u201d taking it upon itself to do what God has said only his Kingdom will do.\nAs for the woman, she means a mighty organization with worldwide membership. (Revelation 17:15, 18) More clues to her identity is shown in her name\u2014Babylon was the place where false worship began after the flood, and after God scattered mankind from that central location to all the earth, they all left; each one with their false religious beliefs, all gotten from Babylon; and by those means the world is filled with all sorts of religious beliefs today that, though different, are similar in many respects, because they were originally drawn from a common pool.\nThe identity of \u201cBabylon the Great\u201d as being of a religious nature is shown at Revelation 18:23 where she's accused of \u201cspiritistic [a religious influence] practices.\u201d For her to have misled \u201call the nations,\u201d she must represent more than just one religion. As per Revelation 17:5, think of her as the mother organization of false religions, and think of the many false religious groups existing today as her \u2018daughters.\u2019 Together, they have produced the disgusting fruits of \u2018divination, magic, sorcery, necromancy, etc.\u2019\u2014Deuteronomy 18:10-12.\nSo, Revelation 17:16 tells of an approaching time when all the political forces on earth, backed up by the UN, will launch an attack against religion and bring a terrible end to many of them. Again, as in the first century, only \u201cthe chosen ones,\u201d i.e, the \u201cpure religion,\u201d will escape.\u2014Matthew 24:22; James 1:27.\nThis is the modern-day \u201cabomination of desolation.\u201d", "The LORD had promised repeatedly that if Israel did not repent then the LORD would turn their prosperous land into a desolate\nruin:\n[2Ch 30:7 CSB] (7) \"Don't be like your fathers and your brothers who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their ancestors so that he made them an object of horror as you yourselves see.\n[Jer 4:7 CSB] (7) A lion has gone up from his thicket; a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his lair to make your land a waste. Your cities will be reduced to uninhabited ruins.\nHe specifically says that Jerusalem would be completely destroyed:\n[Jer 7:34 CSB] (34) \"I will remove from the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem the sound of joy and gladness and the voices of the groom and the bride, for the land will become a desolate waste.\n[Jer 25:18 CSB] (18) Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah, its kings and its officials, to make them a desolate ruin, an example for scorn and cursing -- as it is today;\n[Jer 44:6, 22 CSB] (6) \"So my fierce wrath poured out and burned in Judah's cities and Jerusalem's streets so that they became the desolate ruin they are today. ... (22) \"The LORD can no longer bear your evil deeds and the detestable acts you have committed, so your land has become a waste, a desolation, and an example for cursing, without inhabitant, as you see today.\nHe would make the temple a ruin:\n[Jer 22:5 CSB] (5) \"But if you do not obey these words, then I swear by myself -- this is the LORD's declaration -- that this house will become a ruin.' \"\nHow would the LORD bring about this desolation? As he always did: through heathen nations. Jesus said that this was going to happen within his own generation (within the next 40 years):\n[Mat 23:29-39 RSV] (29) \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, (30) saying, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' (31) Thus you witness against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. (32) Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers. (33) You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell? (34) Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, (35) that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechari'ah the son of Barachi'ah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. (36) Truly, I say to you, all this will come upon this generation. (37) \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! (38) Behold, your house is forsaken and desolate. (39) For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'\"\nJesus told them that Jerusalem would be surrounded by an army and accomplish God\u2019s vengeance for Jerusalem\u2019s rejection of the Messiah:\n[Luk 21:20-24 NLT] (20) \"And when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then you will know that the time of its destruction has arrived. (21) Then those in Judea must flee to the hills. Those in Jerusalem must get out, and those out in the country should not return to the city. (22) For those will be days of God's vengeance, and the prophetic words of the Scriptures will be fulfilled. (23) How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days. For there will be disaster in the land and great anger against this people. (24) They will be killed by the sword or sent away as captives to all the nations of the world. And Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the period of the Gentiles comes to an end.\nThe abomination that makes [Jerusalem and the temple] desolate was the Roman army. There may be a more specific reference to Titus or the disrespectful acts of the Roman leadership toward the temple but at the end of the day the important thing to know is that Matthew 24, Luke 21 and the Revelation are all about the Roman destruction, massacre and ruination of Jerusalem and the temple and the Jewish people was the long promised judgment upon Israel for their unfaithfulness to their LORD.\nIt has nothing to do with modern times:\n[1Pe 4:17 NKJV] (17) For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?\n[1Jo 2:18 NKJV] (18) Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour.\n[Mat 3:10 NKJV] (10) \"And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\n[Mat 23:36 NKJV] (36) \"Assuredly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.\n[1Pe 4:7 NKJV] (7) But the end of all things is at hand; therefore be serious and watchful in your prayers.\n[Rev 22:10 NKJV] (10) And he said to me, \"Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand.\nJosephus wrote of Jerusalem after the war:\n\u2026This was the end which Jerusalem came to by the madness of those that were for innovations; a city otherwise of great magnificence, and of mighty fame among all mankind. [18]\nAnd truly, the very view itself was a melancholy thing; for those places which were adorned with trees and pleasant gardens, were now become desolate country every way, and its trees were all cut down. Nor could any foreigner that had formerly seen Judaea and the most beautiful suburbs of the city, and now saw it as a desert, but lament and mourn sadly at so great a change. For the war had laid all signs of beauty quite waste. Nor had anyone who had known the place before, had come on a sudden to it now, would he have known it again. But though he [a foreigner] were at the city itself, yet would he have inquired for it.

Classics, bestsellers and celebrity books often are released in hard cover. The book market is a bit like a lottery. Editors bet or speculate on what will sell many copies.

So who knows, but as I\u2019ve often said, with a brink and mortar NY publisher you are likely to have 250 salespeople in the field pushing your book, in addition to being on the web.", "There are several points.\nFirst: it is much harder to get a self-published book into physical bookstores than it is through a traditional publisher. You probably won\u2019t ever get into markets like Target, Wal-Mart, grocery stores, or airports either. Together, this still comprises about 60% of all book sales in the US, and it\u2019s a whole lot more in most other countries.\nSecond: Since I mentioned other countries, it\u2019s much more likely for a traditionally published book to be translated into other languages and sold in those territories. Foreign publisher and language rights are in many cases substantial sources of income.\nThird: A traditional publisher pays you up-front advance money. You don\u2019t have to pay it back if the book doesn\u2019t sell to those expectations. The publisher pays for professional cover art and book design, registers copyright in your name, pays for professional content and copy editing, marketing, distribution, and promotion. You are not required to pay anything. You can (and likely should) supplement their efforts, but it isn\u2019t a requirement.\nFourth: it is extremely difficult for a self-published title to hit a major recognized bestseller list. Hitting a major list (and not just an hourly sales list on Amazon, but their Top 50 weekly list does count) helps raise your profile, helps get you invited to paid speaking engagements, workshops, special closed anthologies and projects.\nFifth: it\u2019s important to know where your potential audience \u201clives\u201d in terms of where it shops for books. From a 2019 Pew Research article:\nFiction leads with 25% ebook purchases as of 2019. But, for instance, romance readers have more heavily adopted ebooks (to about 60%) and SF/F readers are about 40%. If you\u2019re writing a children\u2019s book, overwhelmingly print. Even upper YA is still mostly print.\nSo where are your readers, in that scenario? Is ebook only where you need to be?\nI have absolutely nothing against self publishing, it\u2019s a viable and workable career choice. I have friends who make great sales there and work very hard at it. But to be successful you need to think not just like a writer, but a publisher, and make all the right business decisions that entails.\nI just prefer working mostly in traditional.", "A traditional book publisher has a much larger network and advertising budget.", "A publisher employs editors, cover designers, and marketers\nA publisher can get your book into bookstores\nA publisher can get your book into libraries\nA publisher can pay an advance\nA publisher handles accounting and taxes\nA publisher can promote your book at trade shows and events", "Okay. \u201cYou can market online yourself?\u201d You have to commit a budget for that.

Other times\u2014most of the time really\u2014the writer is just doing it because they enjoy doing it and they are writing the book for others who enjoy the challenge.\nVery occasionally writers do it just to be difficult, though I suspect that this happens less frequently than people suspect.\nReally \u2018difficult novels\u2019 are just a certain set of styles or techniques that certain people enjoy, just in the same sense that challenging foods (like lutefisk, kim-chi or natto) are enjoyed by some, but not by all. Even people who go to Michelin starred restaurants can enjoy a bag of fritos every now and then.\nFiction is, first and foremost, meant to be enjoyed. It is the mode of enjoyment that differs. People who enjoy drug store romance novels get something out of those novels and people who delve deep into Pynchon get something else. Each gets enjoyment, just different a kind.\n(I will say, as a side note, that difficult novels tend to \u2018last longer\u2019 i.e. they are generally appreciated for a longer period of time than more simply novels. With a few exceptions (like Charles Dickens) very few people, outside of scholars maybe, read popular fiction from the 1920\u2019s though James Joyce\u2019s notably difficult \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is still widely bought, read and studied.)", "No. Some authors seem to write on a \u201cdifficult\u201d level solely to be confusing for the sake of confusion, under the mistaken idea that the answer to the above question is \u201cYes.\u201d And some \u201cdifficult novels\u201d are that way because the author lacks the skills to write with clarity and lucidity. It\u2019s also true, of course, that some books are difficult because they\u2019re grappling with inherently complicated issues.\nOTOH, in the realm of nonfiction, numerous highly talented popular-science writers demonstrate that it\u2019s possible to explain very difficult concepts in a style that any intelligent reader can understand. E.g., in the past, Isaac Asimov, and in the present, Steven Pinker and Richard Dawkins (whose view of religion is detestable to me, but whose ability to explain concepts such as the \u201cselfish gene\u201d is brilliant).", "Not necessarily!", "Yeah, difficult novels are better cause it make men think clearly instead of deeply. it most times gives solutions to the day to day activities of life.", "Difficult novel aren't necessarily better on their own, there are a lot of factors.

We shall take up 4 the Internet developments for the time being.\nref: Ref: http://www.history.com/topics/inventions/invention-of-the-i\nion-of-the-internet is very useful and the steps therein are taken up in the write up below:\nStarting from the fears of lagging in Technology in the minds of Americans due to Sputnik ( 1957) a space ball launched by erstwhile USSR, the journey took through various steps and lead to what is now being called \u201cInformation Technology(IT)\u201d. They are:\n1.Though Sputnik has nothing to do with telephone\nconnections ,American fears were that there will be large scale attack on communications of USA.\n2.NASA together with American defense increased its\nresearch efforts and Academics also put their thinking into the problem.\n3.American Research Project Agency ( ARPA) took some shape to connect computers enabling them to speak to each other even from distances. An MIT scientist Licklider, (ARPA inclusive)proposed a galactic network but there was not so much of yield-1962\n4. In 1965 M.I.T. developed \u201cpacket switching\u201d that breaks data down into blocks,or packets, before sending it to its destination computer.Each packet can take its own route from place to place.That reduced the vulnerability.\n5. \u201cLOGIN\u201d- A computer from UCLA could send \u201cLO\u201d\nthe first two letters to Stanford but ARPA crashed-1969.\u201dNode to Node\u201d- concept was taking shape.\n6. By 1969 four computers were connected to the ARPAnet.But the network grew steadily in 70\u2019s.\n7. In 1971, it added the University of Hawaii\u2019s ALOHAnet, and two years later it added networks at London\u2019s University College and the Royal Radar Establishment in Norway. As packet-switched computer networks multiplied, however, it became more difficult for them to integrate into a single worldwide \u201cinternet.\u201d- Ref: http://www.history.com/topics/inventions/invention-of-the-i\nion-of-the-internet\n8. By the end of the 1970s, a computer scientist named Vinton Cerf had begun to solve this problem by developing a way for all of the computers on all of the world\u2019s mini-networks to communicate with one another. He called his invention \u201cTransmission Control Protocol,\u201d or TCP. (Later, he added an additional protocol, known as \u201cInternet Protocol.\u201d The acronym we use to refer to these today is TCP/IP.) One writer describes Cerf\u2019s protocol as \u201cthe \u2018handshake\u2019 that introduces distant and different computers to each other in a virtual space.\u201d\n9. The World Wide Web\nCerf\u2019s protocol transformed the internet into a worldwide network. Throug 80\u2019s files and data were transferred successfully between computers.\nIn1991 the internet took further shape.Tim Berners-Lee from Switzerland introduced the World Wide Web: an internet that was not simply a way to send files from one place to another.But it was itself a \u201cweb\u201d of information that anyone on the Internet could retrieve too.Thus Berners-Lee was in a way the creator of the Internet that we use today.\nSince then, the internet has changed in many ways. In 1992, a group of students and researchers at the University of Illinois developed a sophisticated browser that they called Mosaic. (It later became Netscape.) Mosaic offered a user-friendly way to search the Web: It allowed users to see words and pictures on the same page for the first time and to navigate using scrollbars and clickable links.\nThere was realization that information plays role and in itself and by itself can be called a technology.Universities started thinking whether\nInformation Technology can be a subject of study at teaching.\nHence,approximately 1960-1990 can be called the incubation period of\nInformation Technology. Not surprisingly the role of USSR was almost negligible as they did not play any role. Copy cats were there all over on which we read often\nThat same year1992,, Congress decided that the Web could be used for commercial purposes. As a result, companies of all kinds hurried to set up websites of their own, and e-commerce entrepreneurs began to use the internet to sell goods directly to customers. More recently, social networking sites like Facebook have become a popular way for people of all ages to stay connected.Added to these the developments in e-mail,mobile phone,software,data science,tablet,i-Pad,touch screen technology etc., made the present world."], "date_list": ["Apr 16, 2020"], "question_author": "Tiyenn Infotech", "view_list": [13]}, "406": {"no_of_follower": 3, "respond_collected": 3, "name_list": ["Bryan Calkin", "David Micah Ferola", "Arthur Foley"], "question_title": "What are the best non-academic books on physics for busy people?", "topic_list": ["Physics Book Recommendations", "Reading", "Book Recommendations", "Books", "Physics"], "no_of_view": "863", "create_time": "Apr 12, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 1], "ans_list": ["In addition to Stephen Hawking\u2019s \u201cA Briefer History of Time\u201d, there are three YouTube channels I would highly recommend.

SHOULD pupils read a lot in the summer? Heck yes! (Tell me if I\u2019m wrong here, but I am surmising you are wondering if your educational system - your school or your teachers - should \u201cmake you read during the summer\u201d, yes?)\nWell, consider the following that is largely undebatable: The more one reads, the more one generally becomes more intelligent. The more intelligent the person becomes, the more likely he/she will make informed decisions. The more we have people making informed decisions, the more likely we as a society should do well and thrive.\nThe basic definition of ignorance is \u201clack of knowledge or information\u201d or, in short: not knowing. I tell my middle school students in my class called \u201cSkills for Adolescents\u201d we don\u2019t want young ignorant kids (yeah, it sounds like a putdown but it\u2019s not; kids don\u2019t know much - yet) becoming ignorant adults. The whole purpose of mandated education is to become educated, which means becoming less ignorant than if they didn\u2019t go to school at all. (Almost every country on the planet mandates education. Why? Do some research and find which countries DO NOT mandate education and learn what the effect is on both those kids that are forced to stay ignorant and to the countries in which they live.) I tell my students us old people die and the younger generations must then run the countries, and that they better quickly understand that they don\u2019t want ignorant people being our leaders. (Just look a the mess the United States is currently dealing with, both in leadership and those in the general populace that blindly follow.) Again, this statement is largely undebatable: we need (or society would benefit from) more intelligent people, not fewer.\nSo, questioner, I do not know your age, but if you are NOT WANTING to read during the summer, I get that. However, I suggest you pay attention to the trends in employment and education and how those individuals with low skill sets (meaning \u2018ignorant\u2019) are finding it harder and harder to find good-paying jobs. Ask people you know who are older and employed (or better yet, unemployed!) to see if what I am saying is true. This trend is only going to accelerate, according to people who are way smarter than me. The better-paying jobs will surely go to those who are the most skilled, the better read, the least ignorant. The wannabe worker will have to offer some employer something, some skill that will help the employer run a business, and if someone else has more skills and knowledge (less ignorant) to offer than you, who is going to get the job?\nFinally, I truly hope you can start to see the question is not if it is \u201cwrong\u201d to \u201cmake\u201d you read over the summer, it\u2019s how you can help yourself become less ignorant (again, not intended as an insult - sorry if you take it that way) so your opportunities for a successful life after school increase. So, please go find yourself stuff to read. There is a whole world\u2019s worth of knowledge out there to help you make the most of this summer.\nP.S.

Speech and learning disabilities show up and then can be handled by the instructors and parents. Speech and learning problems can include inability to detect words, problems with making sounds, inability to project, like of understanding pronunciation rules, slurring words, etc. This is one area parents should help children early by reading to them really young, speaking to them in adult language and explaining vocabulary and then letting them speak, read and ask questions.\nSometimes personality issues like excessive shyness or cultural difficulties need special handling. But if teachers and parents start early encouraging asking questions, providing answers and reading outloud, it becomes much easier for children to do so.\nIt teaches listeners to respect speakers and patience because there are those who want to demand attention, control discussions, interrupt progress, and or tell people what to think. Communication is an essential skill for human survival and it shouldn't be underrated.\nA round table approach combined with a random way of requiring everyone to participate helps the group to prepare.

And that means wading through a lot of faulty assumptions, revisionist history, a fairly radical reframing of facts, and a lot of bad math.\nIf you want to go all the way back to what supposedly informs modern right-leaning economic ideas, read Adam Smith\u2019s Wealth of Nations. Not only will you be able to better understand the (classical economics) roots of many conservative ideas about the desired goals of economic, governmental, and social arrangements, but you will see how modern neoliberal proposals and experiments (Hayek, Friedman, Mises) depart rather radically from those first principles.\nTo preserve your own sanity, and keep your brain free of outrageous distortions of reality, I would generally avoid the Austrian School and Chicago School folks \u2014 or, if you must, then focus on Hayek; although he completely misunderstands socialism, he has some interesting and applicable ideas about information and economic decision-making \u2014 such as can be found in his \u201cEconomics and Knowledge\u201d lecture/chapter.\nMany modern writers (like Thomas Sowell) have burrowed so far down the rabbit hole their brains appear to be broken. Reading Sowell (or Friedman, for that matter) is really no different than reading a propaganda pamphlet of a bizarre cult member \u2014 or like reading Ayn Rand.\nBut if you truly want to understand the core values and goals of neoliberal ideology \u2014 as nakedly and directly as possible \u2014 then I do highly recommend studying James M. Buchanan and the Virginia School. Here is a competent overview of his legacy: Meet the Economist Behind the One Percent\u2019s Stealth Takeover of America\nLastly, I\u2019ll leave you with my most positive recommendation of the mix, and that is Robert Nozick. Although a philosopher and not an economist, his musings are pretty relevant to modern right-libertarian and market fundamentalist ideals that persist today. I\u2019m always impressed by his clarity of thought\u2026and something else you will not find in Rothbard, Mises, Friedman et al: intellectual honesty. Nozick can admit when his own thinking reaches either a dead end, or an outrageous conclusion \u2014 those other thinkers simply can\u2019t see their own logical fallacies and failings in this regard. You could start with Anarchy, State and Utopia and work outwards from there. However, I do recommend reading John Rawls Theory of Justice to understand what Nozick is responding to in that work.\nMy 2 cents.", "Economics in one lesson.

There were 21 short stories, and five novellas, but none came close to equalling the first book.\nThe last of them was The Haunted Man and the Ghost\u2019s Bargain, a rather cumbersome title that did not sell as well as earlier Christmas novellas, and therefore became the final one. It is not the worst of them. Actually the far more popular Cricket on the Hearth is much worse. Still it is not a work that will appear on many people\u2019s lists of best Dickens works.\nThe action deals with a chemistry teacher called Radlaw, who is gloomily preoccupied with his past life. He regrets his many losses, and wishes that he could have his memory expunged of them. As it turns out, he can.\nRadlaw speaks with a mysterious spirit who seems suspiciously like an adjunct of himself. (Towards the end, even Dickens suggests the possibility that the spirit might be a representation of Radlaw\u2019s bad side, with the kindly servant Milly representing all that is good.)\nThe spirit tells Radlaw that he can make the chemist forget his past, or at least cancel the remembrance of what he felt. Radlaw (with a few misgivings) agrees to this, but there is a catch. Not only does Radlaw lose his own remembrances. He has the gift or curse of causing everyone in contact with him to experience the same thing.\nHe soon realises that this is no good thing at all. Writers often talk about the importance of memory as a source of identity, or the place where we learn things, or see our place in the world or in history. Dickens is making a different point.\nFor Dickens, possessing memory is what gives people warmth as humans. If we lose the capacity to remember the joyful moments we had with others in past life, then why should we feel tolerant with them in the bad times, or forgiving of the wrong they do?\nIf a woman\u2019s looks fade, or a man\u2019s health causes him to stoop, perhaps they will think they made a bad deal in marrying that person if they cannot remember how nice it has been to live with that person for all these years. Our memories of others are what helps us to love them and accept them with all their faults.\nForgiveness is important too. When one of the characters insists that we should remember all the wrongs done to us so that we can forgive them, it seems like a shallow point. Nonetheless there is something in it. How does forgiveness have any power without a memory of the wrong? Why help a person who once hurt you if you have no memories of the times when they behaved better?\nThe story works well on this level and puts across some interesting ideas. The characters are amusing, though none of them are especially memorable. The main weakness in the story comes in the last section.\nWe are told that the good-hearted Milly has a similar supernatural ability to restore people\u2019s kindness and memory by way of her innate warmth, albeit unconsciously. I suppose Dickens needed a solution, but what is he trying to say here?\nIs he implying that if you are bad to people, they will become bad, and if you behave well to people, they will become good? This is not totally wrong of course, but life is not really that simple, as we know. I can\u2019t single-handedly improve the morals of other people by my treatment of them, though it may have some slight impact.\nIt does not help that Milly could give Esther Summerson lessons in how to humblebrag. Like Esther in Bleak House, Milly is always commenting with apparent astonishment on how much everyone seems to like her. Dickens never learnt to realise that praise for his heroines does not work very well when it is the heroine herself who is telling us how much people esteem her.\nOverall though The Haunted Man and the Ghost\u2019s Bargain is a decent and imaginative minor Dickens story that only occasionally overdoes the sentimentality."], "date_list": ["Apr 14, 2020"], "question_author": "Dane John Cobain", "view_list": [62]}, "569": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What were controversies about the book 'Deyal (\u09a6\u09c7\u09df\u09be\u09b2)' by Humayun Ahmed?", "topic_list": ["Humayun Ahmed", "Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman", "Bengali Literature", "Politics of Bangladesh", "History Books", "Book Reviews", "Controversies", "Bangladesh", "Literature", "Books"], "no_of_view": "361", "create_time": "Apr 13, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Md.

Any other character in the book was, of course, presented through his eyes, so it's hard to tell if these people were really as flawed and pathetic as Mersault saw them. Here, though, I began to question my previous dislike.\n\nMersault's background characters were indeed sinister - a girlfriend obsessed with the idea of love, a neighbor who constantly mistreated his old dog, a violent and abusive friend who regularly beat his own girlfriend. However, Mersault never judges any of them, nor tries to stop the behaviour. He analyses and comforts each one, regardless of how \u2018badly' they behave. Mersault is quite indiferrent to strong human emotion, but that is exactly what makes him a truly impartial person and somehow, the personification of objective truth. People say that is what they want, but in all honesty, objective truth is cruel and more often than not, it deforms the people who try to attain it.\n\nMersault is not a sociopath, he does not desire to hurt anyone. In his best moments, Mersault shines with neutral kindness, the likes of which most of us only see in children - when his mean neighbor loses his dog and comes crying to the protagonist's door, Mersault promises to help him find his pet. No show of weakness is too uncomfortable for Mersault, a trait that eventually becomes his demise.\n\n\u201c Mother died today.\u201d\n\nThe opening line of the novel has often been translated wrongly, with the 1946 version using the word \u201cmum\". There is little to no warmth in how Mersault speaks of his mother, explaining that they had long since run out of things to say to each other. The tragedy of a mismatched family of strangers, a peculiar maternal bond that never materialised is more common than people think. Families are often made up of people who have nothing in common with each other. Perhaps this is where Mersault's indifference is first nurtured.\n\nThe protagonist fails to cry at his mother's funeral and this is to be his crime. Make no mistake, Mersault actually commits a crime in the novel, but his lawyer candidly explains that no one could convict a white man for killing an Arab in this little idylic French colony in Africa. The same society that willingly condones racism is less forgiving of \"strange\" outsiders who do not like and are not moved by the same things as them. This is the irony of the book which Mersault bears until the end. For his truth, his otherness, he dies and refuses to pretend, even for his own salvation, to shed a tear at something he deems factual.\n\nIn his last moments, Mersault deeply scares the Catholic priest who offers him absolution - \"I had only a little time left and I didn't want to waste it on God\".\n\nMersault is unique; he recognises the thousands of millions of people who died as nobodies, forgotten in the grandeur of the world, passive and unremarkable and swallowed by time. Human history is nothing but a farce, a power play, a passing fancy and Mersault does not care if he goes down in history as a ruthless psychopath as long as he is true to himself.\n\nMersault is not bad and he is not good, but even if people want to pretend that moral standards have evolved since the Middle Ages, grey is one hell of an uncomfortable colour.\n\nI myself have always desired to become a lawyer. I cannot help but sympathise with Mersault - if a person is different, reacts differently, does this mean he no longer deserves a place in society?\n\n\" I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.\"", "There are innumerable protagonists that I feel sympathy for.\nThe emotion of sympathy for a character is evoked by authors through various ways.

Truth isn\u2019t.", "Fiction is the telling of stories that are based on the life experiencing of the readers (On you, the reader). We learn firstly not via language but by observing and mirroring what we observe. If our observations lead to affirmation to praise, we will retain the experience as a positive one. Or if what we experience is pleasant in nature; as for example sweet taste, we again retain it as a memory that will build over a lifetime a more rounded understanding of both positive and negative experiences. Later, much later we learn to categories these experiences into loose \u2018kinds\u2019, and later again into linguistic categories; dog, cat tree, man, lover, murderer, etc.\nThis is where all literature, not just fiction has a part to play. Research has shown that when we mirror an activity, we not only do so in observation actual life experiences, but also in reading, watching a movie or video. That is why you may shed a tear as the hero suffers or the heroine is treated cruelly. Or you may be physically moved such that you squirm in your seat, you react viscerally, as if you where there yourself. Just by reading or seeing such events and situations affects each of us emotionally, such that we respond to fictional \u2018stories\u2019 psychically. We identify with heroes and heroines such that we \u2018feel\u2019 as they feel, psychically hurt or love as they do - in our imagination. We do this based on a lifetime of implicitly learning and remembering these \u2018kinds\u2019 of experiences, at a level that could be called subconscious, but this information is readily available to hand should we have a \u2018trigger\u2019 situation, be it in reality or in participating in a fictional story. We are able to empathise with another because in mirroring we \u2018take in\u2019 the experiences of others and these experiences have an emotional affect on us, such that we may \u2018feel\u2019 for another, be they real or fictional characters.\nFiction enables us to experience situations, events that we are never likely to be involved in first hand. We can range from love to murder and mayhem. Both of these subjects almost all humans find fascinating because in one form or another, we all seek love and affection and we call know that a day will come when we cease to exist, so all forms of experiences of love and death in all its manifestations both real and fictional affect us emotionally. In this manner we learn about the minds of killers, of victims, of lovers and cheats.\nSo through fictional stories we live viscerally, bodily as well as through the mind. We range over all the many possibilities that human have experienced or even just imagined, and we can do this because we share with writer, actors, scriptwriter etc, these human capacities that every human being experiences in one form or another.

Study & practise pronunciation. Only when you are comfortable saying these words aloud are you confident of using them.\n2. Do the exercises without skipping anything. Do the revisions as well,\nNow, it takes a unique approach to teach words based on two principles.\nThe words are verbal symbols of ideas and\nThe more ideas you are familiar with, the more words you know.\nInstead of teaching you words after words, it introduces you to ideas first. Then, it brings into contact the words associated with those ideas. In this way, the words remain in your mind for a long time as the mind remembers the ideas and stories more than mere facts.\nThe book uses etymological approach to teach new words. Don\u2019t ignore it. This is the heart of building a wider vocabulary.\nNow, what is this approach? It's a divide-and-conquer approach. You dissect a word and see what it is made of. They are prefix, root, and suffix. You study about their origins, history, and like.\nRight, let\u2019s quickly see how we can learn few words by the above approach.\nintrovert - someone who wants to be alone and doesn\u2019t want to hang out.\nextrovert - someone who hangs around almost all the time and likes to be with people.\nambivert - someone who enjoys both spending time with others and sitting alone by himself.\nWhat do these three words have in common? How can you easily get the hang of these words so you\u2019ll remember and use it?\nIt depends on how you turn\nThe words ambivert, introvert, extrovert are all built on the Latin verb verto, to turn.\nIf you turn inward, introvert. Intro \u2014 inward + verto - to turn.\nIf you turn outward(extro-), extrovert.\nIf you turn both(ambi-) ways, ambivert.\nNow, take the prefix intro-. It\u2019s present in introduction, intra-national, intravenous, etc. So, even without understanding what these words mean, you can guess that they have to do something with inward, inner.\nTake the prefix ambi-. It\u2019s present in words like ambivalence, ambidextrous, amphibian, etc. Here, at least you can infer that these words have \u201cboth\u201d , \u201ceither\u201d aspect to them.\nCorrect usage of confusing words\nInterwoven into vocabulary chapters are other chapters on correct usage of common confusing words.\nIt also teaches you how to pronounce English words.\nBesides, it consists of a few tests to assess your level of vocabulary at each stage of the book. So, you have feedback on your learning to tell you if to review the past sessions or move on to next sessions.\nThe book is divided into a number of sessions designed around different ideas:\nPersonality Types\nDoctors\nPractitioners\nScience and Scientists\nLiars and Lying\nActions\nSpeech Habits\nEnemies\nFriends\nCommon Occurrences\nPersonal Characteristics\nAudience\nFor learners who know English well enough to read an English book. It's for anyone who's passionate about English language and want to widen their vocabulary. It's ideal for self-study.\nThe book is quite fun and witty. I absolutely loved studying it. The exercises are interesting, challenging, and very useful. I got confident about English language in general. It didn't just teach me new words but it taught me how to increase vocabulary myself. It gave me strategies.\nHow do you keep on building and reinforcing what you learnt?\nI found books by Erich Segal to be excellent. The author was a scholar in Latin and Greek so he used a lot of words taught in Word Power Made Easy.\nThe Class\nThe Doctors\nThe Prizes\nRight, keep on reading both fiction and nonfiction works.

I was born in the late 80\u2019s and Ranju Hazarika was probably the only author I remember who was incredibly popular among the readers of that time and he was best known for his horror and thriller novels. I still recollect the first time when I read his novel I must've been about 7\u20138 year old and I came across this book at our home called \u201cAndha Ghatak\u201d with rather a scary picture of black cat on the cover and despite knowing that it was meant for adults I started reading it. The book depicts a horrifying account of a severed hand that goes around killing people , a story of vengeance . As I had finished reading few pages, his ingenious illustration of the story was sufficed to send shivers down my spine . I was obviously petrified and a bit perplexed considering whether or not I should be reading further. It gave me such a fright that I barely can stay alone in a room on my own let alone the time of power outage during night time. Meanwhile, I couldn't resist my temptation to read the later half and eventually plucked up my courage and manged to read the entire book. So that was that , if I have to choose any favorite Ranju Hazarika novel it is got to be \u201cAndha Ghatak\u201d.

The films are highly condensed adaptations of the books.\nThe Order of the Phoenix (book 5) is the largest book. The Order of the Phoenix (film 5) is the shortest movie. Just imagine how much was removed!\nDirectors, of course, have a relatively free hand when making their films. They do things such as combine characters, remove characters, and have characters do things that other characters did. An example of the latter is in the Half-Blood Prince book, Tonks finds Harry on the train after Draco petrifies him, breaks his nose, and hides him underneath the invisibility cloak. In the film, Luna finds him.\nThey also add scenes that in their mind quickly frame a situation that is otherwise missing due to the removal of large parts of the book. A good example of this is the dancing scene in the Deathly Hallows between Harry and Hermione in the tent. This was used to show vulnerability and the strength of their relationship as a lot of their travels were not in the film. A bad example is the attack and burning down of the Burrow in the Half-Blood Prince film. It added nothing and was completely out of place.\nMy favourite book is The Deathly Hallows. I know it inside and out. This is due to an unplanned ripping of the audio CDs into my iTunes and hearing random chapters during shuffle play of my music over a long period of time. Because of this, the Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2 films are my least favourite. The unforgivable sins of these are that Harry did not fix his wand, when his wand is a major theme of the story; and the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort was supposed to be fully witnessed by everyone in the Great Hall, but in the film it\u2019s the two of them alone outside and no one sees it happen. The director opted for action for action\u2019s sake, rather than the deeper meaning of everyone finally seeing Harry do what was until then hearsay, as well as the verbal explanation and tying up of everything.", "I like HBP and POA the best.

However, in the books, he doesn\u2019t destroy it and he puts it back in Dumbledore\u2019s tomb.\nIn the movie Half-Blood Prince, Bellatrix and some companions burn down the Burrow (which is completely false and broke my heart to watch.)\nSo just a few major examples.\nMy favourite book? I personally love the second, Chamber of Secrets, because it contains all the elements of a perfect Harry Potter storyline- Hogwarts, plenty of magic/spells, something unknown revealed, time with friends, some love-hate relationships, and the destruction of (part of) Voldemort- which not all of the books have.

Most of the people live 90 years, 100 years and above. Not only they enjoy longevity, they enjoy with vitality even in their 90\u2019s and they don\u2019t have any chronic illnesses. What are the secrets? How can we live long, healthy, happy life?\nThe book provides insights that can help look at our own life and develop some of these good habits. Here\u2019re the key insights I took away:\nDiet/Exercise\nMost of the centenarians consume less meat and processed foods. They drink alcohol in moderation. They eat wide variety of foods, especially vegetables. Variety seems to be the key. Many eat vegetables grown in their garden. They eat almost 206 different foods, including spices, on a regular basis. On an average, studies show, they ate 18 different foods each day. Also, they keep all the food that they consume in one plate which makes it visible of the amount of food they are consuming.\nStudies show, Okinawans eat five servings of fruits and vegetables every day, and at least seven types of fruits and vegetables are consumed on a daily basis!.\nThey eat less than 10 grams of salt per day. They rarely eat sugar and if they do, it\u2019s only cane sugar.\nMost of them eat only 80% stomach full. They stop eating when they feel like stomach is getting full. Never eat 100%, get up when you are 80% full.\nAlso, many practice intermittent fasting two days each week which helps to cleans digestive system and allows it to rest.\nOkinawan\u2019s diet is rich with antioxidants. Antioxidants help slowing down aging process by slowing the oxidation process in cells, neutralizing the free radicals that cause damage and accelerate aging. Be it green tea, or powerful Shikuwasa fruit (citrus fruit like Oranges but 40 times more rich in antioxidants). Choose food in your diet that has antioxidants.\nKeep yourself active. Only by staying active, you will live to 100 years. In Japan, one might be surprised to see how active people remain after they retire. Infact many Japanese people never really retire \u2013 they keep doing what they love for as long as their health allows. Something we all should do.\nTo keep ourselves active, It doesn\u2019t require extensive strenuous exercises; all that is needed is gentle movements throughout the day. Most of them do daily chores, taking walks, working in their vegetable garden etc. Low intensity exercises which allows people to keep moving, but they do it throughout the day.\nA lot of sitting will age you. If you sit for more than 30mins, metabolism slows down by 90%! Read that again. That\u2019s huge. Sitting longer could cause obesity, high blood pressure, imbalanced eating, cardiovascular disease and even some kinds of cancer. Keep moving. Don\u2019t sit at one place for more than 30 mins.\nDo basic exercises in the morning. It is common practice in Japan since World WarII, more so in Okinawa, to do Radio taiso exercises at 6am in groups for about five to ten minutes. These might look like stupid exercises like raising arms above head and turning in circles etc. One of the few times we raise our hands above our heads is when reaching for something in a cupboard or closet, while our ancestors were raising hands all the time gathering things from trees. It is more important than we think. Do these basic exercises.\nSecret to keeping body young is to keep mind active. Mental neurons start aging while we are in our 20\u2019s. Only way to keep this process to slow down is to exercise mental muscles. Get yourself involved in any intellectual activity, playing games, develop curiosity, learning something new, dealing with new situations, interacting with other people, having more positive outlook etc.\nDevelop some habits: Walk to work. Just walk at least 20 mins a day, use feet instead of elevator, participate in social leisure activities (instead of TV or phone), replace junk food with fruits, get right amount of sleep (8 hours), Play with children and pets, Join a sports team etc. There is a saying \u2018keep your fingers active\u2019. If you keep your fingers working, you will cross 100.\nMost of the Japanese get their regular health check up to identify and prevent diseases. It is done through integrated health care system. It is important and get your checkups done regularly.\nManaging Stress/Emotional well being\nStress is one of the chief factors that cause us to age. So many people age prematurely. Stress weakens the cell structures known as telomeres which affects cellular regeneration and how our cells age. When we are under stress, neurons would activate the pituitary and adrenal glands to produce necessary hormones to prepare ourselves for the danger so that we can take action. That\u2019s why little bit of stress is actually good, but repeated stress will make us age prematurely as cells degenerate.\nLearn to manage your stress and worries. Develop stoic attitude \u2013 serenity in the face of a setback can help keep you young as it lowers stress levels. Achieve mindfulness to see yourself and focusing on the self, noticing our responses consciously.\nMany centenarians faced challenges and obstacles and most of them faced them with a positive attitude. People who face challenges/problems, face it with a positive attitude and with a high degree of emotional awareness are already on their way towards longevity. Develop resilience, not only persevere but also choose what is important.\nSleep for 7 to 9 hours, ideal is 8 hours, because sleeping is a great anti-aging tool. Did you know what is model\u2019s best-kept secret? Before the photo shoot day, she would sleep for 9 to 10 hours. Sleeping well produces a hormone called \u201cmelatonin\u201d which produces glow under the skin, wrinkle free. Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant produced by pineal gland. It has many other benefits - Strengthens immune system, Contains element that protects against cancer, Promotes natural production of insulin, Slows the onset of Alzeimer\u2019s disease, Prevents osteoporosis and prevents heart disease. So sleep well everyday atleast for 8 hours.\nCommunity and Social Life\nOne thing that amazed me while reading the book is how much community and active social life has influence on longevity and well being, Japanese culture develops inherent feeling of connectedness among its people. This is called Moai. Japanese form a group of people and build a community to do an activity together, meetings, dinners, games, hobbies they have in common etc. They celebrate birthdays, sing Karaoke\u2019s in the night, dance to the joy, and share their feelings with one another. Even the elders dance to the tunes, participate in games. This develops sense of bonding with broad circle of friends and develops good family relations.\nThey also pool in amount of money monthly and utilize this for these social activities. If there is some amount left out, one person who is in need (because the crops were not good and he is in financial trouble) will get the money as advance which he can pay later. This gives a sense of security because they are being cared in tough times and has influence on their life expectancy.\nThey named the town \u201cVillage of Longevity\u201d which tells me that there is something to assert and give confidence to the people who stay there that they will live longer. It is a sort of affirmation. At 90, they say you are a child and at 100 you are an adult. Affirming someone that they will live longer could become a reality.\nMany believe that food doesn\u2019t help to live longer. Secret is smiling and having a good time with others.\nIKIGAI / Sense of Purpose\nKey thing all centenarians have in common is their Ikigai. The Japanese word Ikigai is nothing but one\u2019s deep sense of purpose for each and every day living. It is that thing for which you wake up looking forward to every morning. It is the thing that drives you in flow. It is the intersection of what you love to do, what the world needs, what you are good at, and what you can be paid for. Clearly defined ikigai brings satisfaction, happiness and meaning to our lives.\nIn Japanese culture, there are lots of examples of artisans who are so many experts in what they do. Someone is so good at finer details that he was irreplaceable at Toyota. Someone is so good in cooking skills that he has mastered the art of cooking salmon for 80 years. They produce outcome which is world class and extremely good. There is simplicity in what they do and do in harmony with nature. They are so much involved in that activity and work in a flow. That\u2019s their ikigai.\nMost of the places where people live the longest and have centenarians are islands - be in Japan, Greece, or Costa Rica. In these islands resources are scarce and communities have to help each other. For many, helping each other is the strong ikigai, which is strong enough to keep them alive.\nHow to find what is one\u2019s ikigai, the true sense of purpose. One needs to find out the activities that make him flow. If an activity is so easy, it will make you bored. If an activity is so hard that you will exhaust yourself and quit. Those are two extremes. If an activity that is bit harder than you could easily do it, however you enjoy doing it immensely, you can do it wholeheartedly that you become one with that activity, and you lose sense of time and completely immerse in the activity, that state is called \u201cFlow\u201d. Whatever interests you and makes you do something in that kind of state could help you find what your real purpose is and your ikigai.\nAs author Viktor frankl told in the book \u201cMan\u2019s search for meaning\u2019, during second world war, in concentration camps the survivors were one who wanted to accomplish something outside the camp and who felt strong need to get out alive. Someone who has goal to achieve and strongly persevere to do so. They survived and lived longer. He who has a \u201cwhy\u201d to live can almost bear with almost any \u201chow\u201d.\nTo find our ikigai - List down all the actions that make you go in flow. Then check what these activities that drive you in flow have in common \u2013 are these activities that you do alone or in groups, why do they drive me into flow, Are these activities more to do with physical activities or more to do with thinking. With this kind of exercise, we may be able to find our Ikigai.\nSometimes, we don\u2019t really have the purpose. Or don\u2019t really know what that is. Or it is that, we have a purpose and we are already working on it, but just that we don\u2019t know about it. Book has an example of a mother who is been working on taking care of their kid \u2013 goes to depression having no meaningful purpose. When asked to visualize in her deathbed, what she did in her life, she actually felt so much she did and realized what she was doing was a great purpose in life. She was already doing it but didn\u2019t realize it. Take some time and put effort to find your purpose.\nIn summary, taking clues from centenarians, we can try to develop habits \u2013 what we eat, how we exercise, how we manage stress, how do we develop relationship and live in community and find out and live our IKIGAI, our sense of purpose. Surely, we can try to add little more years to our life and in the process, we can add little more life to our years as well.", "So I am finally done with reading Ikigai, the book is authored by Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles. And here, in the next 2 minutes, I am going to share my take from this book.\nThis book covers various aspects of life that can help us achieve a long, fulfilling, and happy life.\nStarting with The word derives from iki, meaning life and gai, meaning the realization of hopes and expectations, it is more like the reason you want to get out of your bed each morning.\nLife is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded bu the people who love you\nSo here are my takeaways from Ikigai that are\nAlways try to find what you love doing and that will give you the purpose of this life. It is very important to keep on doing little things that add to the value of your life, making little progress and bringing beauty and helpfulness to others. Learn something new every day, play games, and interact with other people. A positive attitude & emotional awareness (ability to manage emotions) is essential for a good life.\n2. Taking it slow:\nStop being in a hurry and urgency every time in your life, walk slowly and you\u2019ll have a long way to go.\n3. Surround yourself with good friends, friends who uplift you.\n4. Work on your health:\nGet in shape for your next birthday, when you get older make it a daily habit of walking or exercising that will keep you going for a long time. Practice mindfulness through focusing on self and meditation.\n5. Reconnect with nature\n6. Thank people\nAround you, ancestors, and nature. Form close bonds within local communities. Play with children or pets.\n7. Do not fill your stomach when it comes to eating\nIn order to stay healthy always eat a little less than your hunger demands. Fill your belly to 80%\n8. Live in the moment\nStop regretting your past and fearing about your future, make most of today because that is all you have. Smile more. This moment exists only now and won\u2019t come again.\n9. Seven conditions for achieving flow ( Going with the flow is important for a healthy life )\ni) Knowing what to do\nii) Knowing how to do it\niii) Knowing how well you are doing\niv) Knowing where to go (where navigation is involved)\nv) Perceiving significant challenges\nvi) Perceiving significant skills\nvii) Being free from distractions\n10. Antifragility \u2014 things that get stronger when they are harmed\nHow to be antifragile:\n11. Follow your ikigai\nFind the passion which lies inside you which is your unique talent and work on it. It is your mission to find your ikigai.", "One of the key giveaways of Ikigai, the book, is making people aware that Happiness is in Purpose.\nWe try many things to achieve happiness, do many things on a hit and trial basis only to know the happiness we achieve doing any of it, is temporary.\nIkigai defines happiness as a state of mind when you are completely in present, the right now, not worrying about past and future, and lose a track of time in the task you are onto.\nIt says you can only achieve this state when you\u2019re in Flow. That is completely involved in what you\u2019re doing.\nHow to achieve flow?\nAnd knowing exactly the state of mind to achieve knowing exactly what to do, where you have to go, and not obsessing over the goals.\nWhen you\u2019re in flow, you\u2019ll be so much in present you won\u2019t ever worry about past or future.\nAfter all, its all about training your mind to stick to a certain mindset. And its trainable, put more focus to details of things, practice mindfulness, and you\u2019ll be in flow in present, not worrying about past or future.\nAnd it is okay if you haven\u2019t found your purpose yet, life is but a mission to find your Ikigai.

To say why is to reveal one of the story\u2019s biggest spoilers, so stop reading now if you do not wish to know the ending.\nThe ending is quite famous however, and many people will be familiar with it from repute, even if they have not read it. It is perhaps the most downbeat moment in all of Dickens, and he took care never to repeat it again.\nThere are elements of defeat in other Dickens novels, notably Great Expectations and Hard Times, but no Dickens novel is too tragic, not even The Old Curiosity Shop. Perhaps if Dickens had been writing for an audience today, which is more inured to books that end badly, his fiction would have taken a different turn, but he lived in an age where it was considered commercially necessary for books to have a happy ending.\nNonetheless, in The Old Curiosity Shop, Dickens kills off his heroine, Nell Trent, known as Little Nell. Yet she is not a morally ambiguous character. She is the personification of goodness. Indeed the modern reader is likely to be repelled by her one-dimensional purity and innocence, and will struggle to understand the appeal of the book.\nEven by the end of the nineteenth century, Oscar Wilde famously said that one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at Dickens\u2019 description of Nell\u2019s death. The morbid sentimentality employed by Dickens worked well in exploiting the emotions of an early Victorian audience, but this is less possible now.\nIt is difficult to separate fact from fiction. Did Dickens fans in New York City really shout to arriving sailors, \u201cIs Little Nell alive?\u201d If so, they must have anticipated that Dickens was likely to kill Nell off.\nOne person who did not predict that outcome was the Irish nationalist, Daniel O\u2019Connell. He was so upset by Nell\u2019s death that he is said to have thrown the book out of a train window, and complained that Dickens lacked the artistry to write a happy ending for Little Nell.\nO\u2019Connell is right here, but also unfair. It is unlikely that Dickens (or anyone) could have written an artistically satisfying conclusion to The Old Curiosity Shop in which Nell lived happily ever after. Her death seems the natural culmination of her life. She is a tragic figure, and one who finds respite in being with old men and walking around graves. Death seems to have her earmarked from an early stage.\nDickens may not have worked out the details of the plot, judging by some early uncertainty in the style of The Old Curiosity Shop. Master Humphrey disappears from the story after a few chapters, and no effective plot is ever worked out concerning Nell\u2019s brother, Frederick. Dick Swiveller seems to be set up as a feckless, untrustworthy individual, only to turn out as one of the book\u2019s heroes later on.\nNonetheless I can safely say that Dickens probably intended that Nell should die. The only boy who loves Nell is Kit, a likeable enough young man, but clearly not considered worthy of winning Nell\u2019s heart by Dickens. Instead Kit is to be married off to the irritating maidservant, Barbara, a weak and neurotic girl whose vapidity only serves to make Nell look better.\nIs there any way of liking Nell? She seems to be a fixed point of goodness, incapable of character development or fallibility, and this lifts her into being an ideal more than a person. Like Oliver Twist, she can move around the poor and disreputable parts of her world, but Dickens somehow believes that it is possible for them to stay pure.\nNell will not steal or lie to survive. She will radiate goodness until others help her. In the same way, Daniel Quilp, the malignant animalistic dwarf, is an embodiment of pure evil, and beyond any repentance.\nAn interesting perspective on Nell comes from Ingeborg Refling Hagen, the Norwegian author. Hagen is said to have buried a copy of The Old Curiosity Shop in her youth, stating that nobody deserved to read about Nell because nobody (except Hagen) could understand Nell\u2019s pain.\nPerhaps we do need to have shared Nell\u2019s experiences \u2013 her struggle with poverty, her anxiety over her weak grandfather, who steals money from her in order to gamble (another one of Dickens\u2019 weak-natured parental figures), and her loneliness and struggling. She has many friends and allies, but cannot receive their help for long before being driven on.\nIt may be hard to identify with Nell (unless we have had the life experience of Hagen), but it is possible to pity her. She is a young girl who has never had the chance to be a child. She has been forced to act as the responsible adult in her relationship with her grandfather, and she has been exposed to privations and dangers that no child should have to face. Her childhood has been stolen from her.\nOne of the more peculiar and insidious dangers comes from Quilp. It is not only that he has a financial hold on her grandfather. The dwarf has designs on Nell herself. I am not sure how repugnant this seemed to the original audience, but there is a distinct hint of paedophilia in Quilp\u2019s lust for Nell. It is clear that if Nell had lived a few more years, Quilp would have murdered his inexplicably clingy wife, and tried to wed Nell.\nThere are other dimensions to The Old Curiosity Shop. While it is not an allegory, it sometimes feels like one. Nell and her grandfather walk through hellish streets and out into the country, passing through unnamed towns and villages, and encountering people of varying levels of good and evil, before finding solace in the grave.\nA number of the people they meet on the way are displaced entertainers, a topical issue in Dickens\u2019 day, as many were forced on the road to carry out barely-legal shows. Codlin and Harris run a Punch and Judy show, but consider turning Nell in to get reward money. Mrs Jarley, the owner of a waxworks show, is kinder, but even she cannot protect Nell.\nThere is some interest in these scenes with Nell, but often the supporting characters steal the book. It is easier to care about Kit\u2019s adventures, especially when he is wrongly accused of theft, an elaborate frame-up by the corrupt solicitors, Sampson and Sally Brass.\nKit is ultimately saved when Dick Swiveller is able to bring information to light. Dostoevsky was clearly an avid reader of this book. He steals this scene in Crime and Punishment, and the death of a child at the end of The Brothers Karamazov has a similar sentimental feel to Nell\u2019s death.\nPerhaps the best characters are the unfortunately-named Dick Swiveller and The Marchioness. This is because they are essentially good-hearted, but have enough flaws to make them human. Dick is a chancer who runs up huge debts, and appears to be selfishly out for his own ends. However he ultimately shows a more worthy side after he is offered employment by the Brasses.\nThe Marchioness is a curious character. She is a servant of Sally Brass, and essentially a slave. Her origins are unknown. She does not even know her name or age. It is vaguely hinted that she might be a love child of Quilp and Sally Brass, a grotesque enough notion.\nHer tiny size is stressed, but though she seems to be a child, Dickens (just about) steers clear of the question of whether the love affair between Dick and her is as questionable as Quilp\u2019s attraction to Nell. Their relationship does stay Platonic until the end, when we are told that she looks about 19.\nNowadays, readers might also shift uncomfortably in the scenes involving the sad schoolmaster who seems a little too attached to one of the schoolboys, and later Nell. Sadly we no longer live in an innocent age where we can read these things in a relaxed manner.\nThe Marchioness is a typically timid heroine, as is often the case in Dickens, but she shows some sly qualities. She listens at keyholes, and she steals keys. These activities are not done from malice, but as a matter of self-preservation. She is kept starved, and she is locked downstairs most of the time, causing her fears that she will be forgotten if there is a fire.\nIn the end, this enigmatic little waif proves to be the saviour of Dick and Kit.

Illiad/Odyssey)", "It\u2019s usually a mix of several periods but the most prominent in those you mention is, by far, the Late Middle Ages. That is 1200s\u20131500 AD.\nSometimes they have a lot from early Renaissance but they usually do not have gunpowder since they have magic and dragons instead.\nConan and Lord of The Rings are supposed to take place in some distant prehistoric period. But they have technology of the Late Middle Ages and the excuse for that is the Atlantis myth that is a strong influence in both universes. We see that in the prolong of Conan.\nBut also Numenor that made the great kingdoms of Men in Tolkien\u2019s Middle Earth was a great island in the West, greatly advanced that was destroyed much like Atlantis.\nA highly advanced civilisation that was closing to the age of renaissance but collapsed. It\u2019s a popular myth in fantasy. There are genres that include gunpower and steam engines(steampunk, for example) but they are distinctly different from the poppular epic fantasy in question.\nWhy do I say Late Middle Ages? Let\u2019s start with Conan. The first movie borrowed costumes from the movie about Alexander Nevsky, a historical drama about events that took place in 1200s.\nConan\u2019s main antagonist in the movie, Tulsa Doom features the iconic helmet.\nThe movie has a mix of Valkyrie like characters, teutonic like armour, Mongol like people and names\u2026all fighting together. Pretty much what happened in the 1200s in Eastern Europe with the Mongol invasion.\nLord of the Rings also shares this trope. The evil hordes of the East invade the West. The armies also have weapons of the period. Even if you check the poor orcs at the battle of Pelenno,outside Mins Tirith, they have a variety of weapons that were common in late middle ages to face the charge of the Rohirrim:\nBut it\u2019s even more obvious when you look at the armour of an Uruk hai pikeman(pretty much like the Swiss) or the kinda similar armour of Minas Tirith soldiers.\nThey even have crossbows which is typical of the period.\nAnd of course trebuchets in Minas Tirith. These machines were used in Europe mostly in 1200\u20131500 AD.\nAlso, the castles themselves seem quite of that time. Before the middle ages the Romans would use a lot of bricks, that we don\u2019t see often in epic fantasy. And after the middle ages, walls would be lower and thicker,star shaped forts etc.\nThe most obvious example of the resemblance between epic fantasy and late middle ages is Game of Thrones(ASOIAF). Not only the weapons, armors, castles and the political system is similar but the society and the events are based on Europe of the late middle ages. The main story is based on the War of the Roses that took place in England 1455\u20131487 AD. We have a bank in Braavos, a city that resembles Italian cities of the period(especially Venice) and around 1400 we get the first banks\u2026in Italy. The Red Wedding incident is inspired by a similar incident that took place in the 1400s, in Scotland.\nAlso, ships are interesting.

It is quite evident that the Lord is not finished dealing with his servant. The Lord prepared a fish to swallow him up.\nThere is no story in all the Bible that has caused so much derision, mockery, and blundering exegesis as the story of Jonah and the whale. As someone said, it might appear that the whale swallowed up the commentators as well as the prophet. In many areas of biblical study, secular research often brings historical data alongside the Scriptures to shed modern light on ancient events. While we don\u2019t wait for this evidence before we believe the Bible (we believe the Bible because it is the Word of God), discoveries often marvelously confirm that which many felt to be fanciful or mythical. The biblical story of a fish swallowing a man is that kind of event. Our own research in biblical or non-biblical books will give us pages of detail about actual cases of fish large enough to swallow humans, and of humans who were swallowed by fish and lived to tell about it!\nConsider the 100-foot-long sulphur bottom whale caught off Cape Cod in 1935, with a mouth 12 feet wide, and multiple stomach compartments large enough for several men. This mammal is know to be able to disgorge offending stomach contents just as Jonah was disgorged by his great fish.\nRecords exist of an English sailor who fell overboard in the English Channel, was swallowed by a monstrous whale shark, and was found alive when the shark was caught 48 hours later. There was a similar experience of another sailor on a whaling ship near the Falkland Islands who was swallowed by a giant whale but found alive when the whale was harpooned and cut open a number of hours later.\nInteresting as these stories are, they really are not the point. We do not need the records of natural man to prove to us that a sovereign God can create, and direct, the elements of His creation to accomplish His purposes. If we do not believe that God could, and did, prepare a giant fish to discipline a prophet, then we will have trouble believing as well that a dead man named Jesus of Nazareth came back to life. Don\u2019t forget\u2014it is the three days of Jonah in the belly of a great fish that Jesus used to predict His own resurrection after three days.

And the great white sharks have roamed all the seas, i", "The whale shark can be up to 70 feet long And is found in the Mediterranean Sea", "The Bible does not say except it was a great fish", "The great fish in the story of Jonah represents the god of the Ninevites, Dagon. This would be particularly relevant to early hearers of the story because they would know instantly that in Jonah\u2019s rebellion against God, and in his contempt for the Ninevites, he is swallowed up by their fish-god as a form of admonishment.\nThe book of Jonah is a comedy of ironies and a testimony to God\u2019s ability to get an important message to desperate people, even when using a reluctant prophet. Jonah sat on a nearby hill for days waiting for God to destroy the Ninevites, but He did not.\nThere God provided plant which gave Jonah shade. Then God provided a worm to destroy the plant, at which point Jonah says to God, \u201cIt would be better for me to die than put up with this.\u201d\n\u201cIs it right for you to be this angry about the plant?\u201d Replied God.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Said Jonah, \u201cI\u2019m angry enough to want to die.\u201d\nGod concludes the story by saying, \u201cYou have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend it or make it grow.

Robert Cushman Murphy, a scientist at the American Museum of Natural History and extremely knowledgeable about whales, said a man could be swallowed whole by a sperm whale, but that no man could survive in a whale any longer than if he were held under water. This is just one reason the Book of Jonah is now widely regarded as having been written as a novel with a theological purpose.\nWhich brings us to a more modern legend sometimes used to support the veracity of the Book of Jonah. This tells of a crewman named Bartley from the Star of the East who, in 1891, supposedly spent fifteen hours in a whale but was cut out alive. The Australian Geographic\ndebunked this story:\nHistorians have since concluded that the Star of the East was not a whaler, and there was no James Bartley on its crew manifest, while scientists confirm it is not possible to survive for 15 hours in the stomach of a sperm whale. For nearly 100 years the media largely swallowed this whale of a story without once trying to interview or find a picture of Bartley. It\u2019s a great example of never letting the facts get in the way of a good story.", "The great fish was Almighty God incarnate in fish flesh form.

The Hebrew word for dove is JONAH(yownah).", "Jonah and Leedsichthys problematicus.\nMatthew Murdock\nThe book of Jonah talks about a \u2018great fish\u2019 that was large enough to swallow a man alive. Many have claimed that no whale or fish could ever swallow a man. These critics, however, are unaware of the fossil evidence of \u2018great fish\u2019 in countries all around the world. About ten years ago I visited the Ann Arbor Museum of Natural History in Michigan. I recall staring in amazement as I stood next to a skull of an extinct fish named Dunkleosteus terrelli (figure 1). The skull itself was about 1 m high, but the largest skull found was 1.2 m high. I thought to myself that if the skull was this big, then its body length must be incredible. Some quick research indicated that this armored fish may have reached a length of almost 5 m. If it were not for the glass separating us, I could have easily climbed into its mouth.\nWorld\u2019s biggest fish fossil found; but largely ignored\nThe fossil bones of a giant fish named \u2018Leedsichthys problematicus\u2019 (figure 2) provide support for the reliability of the book of Jonah. \u2018L. problematicus\u2019 was named after an English farmer, Alfred Leeds, who discovered the first fossils of this species in the late 1800s. The name \u2018problematicus\u2019 refers to the problem paleontologists encountered trying to classify this new fish. Leeds sold this skeleton to the Hunterian Museum (Glasgow University) way back in 1915, but few have ever heard of this discovery. Oddly enough, work on reconstructing it began only about five years ago. This fish, alleged to be 155 million years old, was an astonishing 15 m long (>50 feet). But a new specimen of the same species found recently surpasses this, reaching a length of about 30 m!\nThis is about the length of 3 school buses and is twice the size of a whale shark (14 m), or about the size of a blue whale, making it the largest fish ever discovered. Unlike Dunkleosteus, Leedsichthys would not have torn its prey apart with its teeth. In fact it didn\u2019t have teeth on its jaws; it used thousands of gill rakers with needle-like teeth to filter plankton and small fish from the water. This fish was large enough to swallow a man whole.\nHow did Jonah survive inside the creature? Is it possible for Jonah to have remained undigested? Some sharks are able to control their digestive systems, and could keep from digesting a swallowed object for several days. Because of this, undigested food is commonly found inside shark stomachs during dissection.\nThe whale shark can turn its stomach inside out and bring up its contents in a process called gastric eversion. The whale shark may not have been the only \u2018fish\u2019with this ability, and Jonah\u2019s body could have been easily \u2018spat out\u2019 upon dry land. Conclusion We must recognize that it is not possible to know with certainty what species of fish swallowed Jonah; the Bible does not tell us. But having found fossil evidence of some of these giants helps support biblical accuracy.\nEndnotes:\n1 Dunkleosteusis named after Dr David Dunkle, one of the first men to study this creature. The name Dunkleosteus literally means \u2018Dunkle\u2019s bones\u2019.\n2 The whale shark is not a whale at all, but a member of the shark family.", "It is interesting to note that the Greek New Testament uses the word \u201cwhale,\u201d while the Hebrew book of Jonah says that \u201cthe Lord had prepared a great fish.\u201d (Jonah 1:17.)\nThe fact that the animal was \u201cprepared\u201d could indicate that it was not a conventional animal, and that it was easily capable of swallowing a man whole. In addition, there exists a more recently documented case of a man who was actually swallowed by a whale and lived to tell about it.\nIn 1891, a whaling crew operating off the Falkland Islands was beset with difficulties. A whale, which emerged when a harpoon sunk into its flesh, turned on the small boat and capsized it. Three of the men who were overboard were unable to make it back to the mother vessel.\nLater that evening, the dying whale surfaced and was rigged to the side of the whaling ship. When the crew began the task of butchering it, one of the three missing men, James Bartley, was found inside the whale\u2019s stomach. He had survived in his mammalian undersea prison for 15 hours! The acidity of the whale\u2019s stomach had permanently bleached his skin and removed his hair, and he was almost blind. Unable to continue his chosen trade, Bartley turned to shoe making and remained a cobbler the rest of his life.\nThe seemingly impossible story of Jonah becomes more believeable when viewed in relationship to the equally fantastic\ufeff\u2014but true\ufeff\u2014modern event.

Richard III battling the Byzantine Empire in a world where magic exists, and Julian the Apostate won his campaign against Christianity.", "Several alternative history novels come to mind. Over the years my favorite series has been the Emberverse books by S. M. Stirling, which I\u2019m not altogether sure qualifies as an alternate history: On a certain date in 1998, all manner of high-energy technologies, including gunpowder and electricity, simply stop working. Most of the world\u2019s population dies, and the survivors prove to be endlessly inventive in forging after-Change societies. But it\u2019s definitely more of a fantasy series than an alternate history.\nThen there are a bunch of science fiction stories that were written in a future that has now come and gone. For example, The Door into Summer by Robert Heinlein was written in 1957 but was set in 1970 and 2000, so the events described in that book have now become a kind of \u201calternate future.\u201d The same thing is also somewhat true of the Star Trek franchise, with its ruinous Eugenics Wars in the 1990s.\nA couple of other series I\u2019ve liked immensely but which aren\u2019t quite a straight alternate history would be The Tales of Alvin Maker by Orson Scott Card, and the Worldwar Series by Harry Turtledove. Alvin Maker is set in early 19th Century America, but one where magic is a very real force; and the Worldwar books start off with World War II being interrupted by an invasion of lizard people from another planet.\nOne book that looks like a more standard alternate history is The Yiddish Policeman\u2019s Union by Michael Chabon. It\u2019s set in a world where the Jews lost the 1948 war and were forcibly expelled from Palestine; they have instead created a Jewish state on Sitka Island in Alaska. It\u2019s an interesting premise but unfortunately Chabon does very little with it; instead he gives us a murder mystery (and a very good one, I hasten to add) that could have been set anywhere. The setting is wasted, almost irrelevant to the story.\nProbably the best \u201cpure\u201d alternate history series that I have read was Turtledove\u2019s Southern Victory series in which the South does indeed win the Civil War. The series goes on and on, unevenly, up through a parallel World War II; The South goes on to lose World War I but keeps its independence, and the most fascinating part of the books is the rise of Jake Featherston, an angry but charismatic Southerner who becomes dictator of the South as an obvious parallel to Adolf Hitler. For some reason I could always picture Sean Penn in the role perfectly.\nStand-alone alternate history books I\u2019ve loved:\nIf the South Had Won the Civil War by MacKinlay Cantor. A slim novel by a Pulitzer Prize winning author, but it has importance because it was published in 1961 and had great influence on everything that came afterward.\nThe Plot Against America by Philip Roth. This book by another Pulitzer winner, elects Charles Lindbergh president in 1940, and America descends into anti-Semitism.\nIn the Presence of Mine Enemies by Harry Turtledove. Germany has won World War II and most of Europe is under Nazi rule.

Steinbeck permanently changed American English in fiction.\nJoyce and Wolfe both died in 1941 during WWII. They and Steinbeck experienced two world wars, and the Great Depression for ten years of the period between the wars. Henry Miller and Anais Nin likewise.\nThose experiences might have something to do with the depth of their writing which I have yet to see in any current American author. And though Fitzgerald lived through WWI and the Great Depression, I can\u2019t find that experience in his books.\nIan McKewan, Louise Erdrich and Kashuo Ishiguro are in the ball park of profound writers.\nFor me, those writers since 1960 who come the closest to pre-WWII writers in depth of perception, the craft of writing, and new invention in the novel form are: Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabelle Allende in South America, with the invention of \u201cmagical realism,\u201d Carlos Fuentes in Mexico with his experimental fiction structures, and Jose Gironella in Spain, who wrote his trilogy about the Spanish Civil War, which is considered one of the greatest European novels of the 20th century.\nAll of these writers took part in historic social and political shifts in their countries, including civil wars and in at least one instance a military coup that destroyed democracy.

This is a fascinating question, as evidenced by the responses so far, most of which focus on thematic differences rather than literary movements or styles, and with which I quite concur, especially John Rodriquez and Henry Martin. However, in his brief answer Audun Morch nails the main differences between the first and second halves of the 20th century as the foundational shift between modernism and postmodernism which occurred during WWII. The first sub-movements in postmodernism flowered with the Beats: Ginsberg, Snyder, Burroughs, Kerouac, et al. and the rise of magical realism with Borges, Marquez, Allende, Llosa and others.\nBut come the end of the 20th century we see the rise of post-postmodernism, in effect a reaction to postmodernism even as that movement was a reaction to modernism. Also termed metamodernism, this emergent movement encompasses critical theory, philosophy, literature, art, and architecture. Because we are in the early stages of this movement it is rather hard to define as yet, but in simple (way too simple) terms we see the 20th century in two halves, modernism (which began in the late 19th century) and postmodernism, with an emergent shift to metamodernism.", "Hi, Julian.

Simple - it\u2019s the cultural shift that allowed most of art to get away with exploring darker, deeper themes.\nBasically, the way I see it is this: After WWI and WWII, people had been through so much shit that a little risque art did not bother them. Artists, and writers especially, started exploring darker themes in the human psyche. There were movements to explore the darkness, and there were movements that attempted to get away from the darkness while still addressing some serious issues. Take surrealism. Whimsical on the surface, profound and eye opening between the lines. Beatniks - same.

You need to be able to get them in translation too though so that you don\u2019t waste most of your time looking up dictionaries. It isn\u2019t a bad idea to work with books that you enjoyed as a child and would like to read again. However, if your idea is to work with lots of simpler picture books with only a line of text per page, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to get translations of them, so you\u2019ll just end up having to look up dictionaries a lot, and that eats up a lot of time. That\u2019s why your starting point should be to use the graded texts in a language course as your introduction to reading the language, and all of those should have translations with them if the course is properly designed. If translations are absent, get a better course. By the end of the course you\u2019ll still be a long way from being able to read proper text at any speed, but a well-chosen children\u2019s book will give you a slightly gentler introduction to that than adult books, but the difference isn\u2019t as great as you might expect, so the right adult book can be fine.

Destry\u2019s name is changed from Harrison to Tom. Probably at Mix\u2019s insistance. The 1939 film starring James Stewart shares nothing with the novel except Destry\u2019s last name. The 1954 version starring Audie Murphy is practically a scene for scene remake of the \u201839 film.\nIn the novel Destry is a wild cowboy who is always up to something, but he\u2019s pretty much admired by the town\u2019s people and they tolerate his antics. Partly because he\u2019s so affable and partly because he\u2019s a dangerous hombre. The town rich business man resents Destry\u2019s popularity and frames him for a stagecoach robbery and Destry is sent to prison. When he is released and returns to town, he\u2019s a shadow of his former self. Or so it would seem. It\u2019s actually an act to lull the people into a false sense of security so Destry can exact his revenge.\nThe 1939 plot is a typical town needs to be ridded of its lawless element plot. People are killed for their land. The honest sheriff disappears and the town drunk is appointed in his place as a joke. The new sheriff had at one time been the fearless deputy to famous town tamer Destry. Destry was shot in the back and killed years before. But thw new sheriff sends for Destry\u2019s son Tom to be his deputy and clean up the town. Tom eschews violence and doesn\u2019t even wear a gun to the great amusment of the criminal element. But Tom is tougher than he appears and rids the the town of the crooks and saves the day.\nI can\u2019t say which is better, but I enjoyed the \u201839 and \u201854 films much more than the book or the 1932 iteration.", "Although I haven\u2019t seen the movie, I understand THE LAWNMOWER MAN, based on one of Stephen King\u2019s more forgettable short stories, of the same name, had nothing in common with the print source except the title and a lawnmower."], "date_list": ["Apr 12, 2020", "Apr 12, 2020", "Apr 12, 2020", "Apr 12, 2020", "Apr 12, 2020"], "question_author": "Kris Craig", "view_list": [51, 45, 9, 93, 45]}, "155": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Kate Moore"], "question_title": "Who is your favorite philosopher that guides your way of teaching?", "topic_list": ["Modern Philosophy", "Guides", "Teaching in Schools", "Philosophers", "Teaching", "Philosophy", "Book Recommendations", "Books", "Philosophy of Everyday Life", "Education"], "no_of_view": "25", "create_time": "Apr 12, 2020", "upvote_list": [1], "ans_list": ["Who is your favorite philosopher that guides your way of teaching?\nKohlberg, Maslow, Bloom, Betts.,and Renzuli.

By means of an outside agency, usually supernatural, the hero is shown the error of his ways and begins to appreciate his life and the people around him.\nThere are one or two differences in The Chimes. For example, the hero is not following an evil philosophy of life built up by himself, but is rather a working man whose misanthropic and self-hating views are taken from people in authority who despise the poor.\nThe political economist Alderman Cute sneers at Trotty, the elderly ticket-porter for eating food and wishing to allow his daughter Meg to marry her fianc\u00e9, Richard. Cute feels that they hardly have a right to live at all, let alone get married in destitution.\nThese views are backed by the local MP Sir Joseph Bowley, a supposed philanthropist who takes Trotty to task for having debts, an easy complaint to be made by a powerful man who can easily afford to pay his own debts.\nInstead it is left to Trotty and Meg to show real charity when they dissuade the poor countryman Will Fern from seeking help, accompanied by his small niece. They realise that Cute will have Fern imprisoned, so they give shelter to the uncle and niece for one night. As ever it is the poor who prove more charitable than those who have the money to give.\nNonetheless the dubious opinions of Cute and Bowley have infected Trotty\u2019s mind and prevent him from enjoying what he has. He is drawn to the church by the chimes of the bells, and there he encounters spirits and goblins.\nLike Scrooge, Trotty is shown an alternative bleaker future that may happen if he gives in to despair Meg and Richard defer marriage until it is too late, and the broken Richard becomes an alcoholic. Fern is arrested and his niece turns to prostitution. Meg has a child by Richard, but is ready to kill herself and her child when the dream ends.\nWhat is curious about the ending is that there is no clear action that takes place that will prevent the events happening in the future. In A Christmas Carol, Scrooge has the option of reformation. Here the only difference is that Meg and Richard decide to marry sooner rather than later, and we hope that they can avoid a bad fate, but there is no Deux ex machina to rescue them from poverty.\nAs with other Christmas stories, Dickens throws in a moral message. He deplores the conditions of poverty that force people to lead terrible lives, and the self-serving callous philosophies developed by the ruling class to justify these iniquities.\nThe Chimes is not one of Dickens\u2019 best works, but it is readable, and it has a good heart.

This process could be done near the end of a star\u2019s lifespans to reset its age and avoid the expansion that comes with old age, or it could be done every so often to keep the star at a certain age. Both would keep the planet(s) habitable for significantly longer. I will mention this would take WAY more resources than humanity currently has access to, but I think it could be possible.

Mythology is derived from the Greek words, Mythos (that which is not necessarily logical or true) and Logos (that which is logical). So, we can say that Mythology is a logical explanation to that which may not appear logical to an outsider.\nNow, the reason mythological texts are important is because it gives us a sneak-peek into the cultural history of the society. It tells us how our ancestors viewed society, how certain practices - which may not make sense now - came into being an integral part of our culture, how the society unites under the common belief system. It is a historical record for the society.\nIt is however very important that you remove any filters before reading such a text. You must realize that these texts have been written down thousands of years ago. Our understanding of the society changes every year as we grow, so do not judge the texts too hard. Also majority of the so called mythological texts around the world have been translated by outsiders. I am not against this, as it shows that outsiders are interested in your culture, but at the same time, it is true that they do not have the in-depth knowledge and understanding of these text as an insider, who has literally lived them. This has evidently led to lot of incorrect conclusions and misunderstanding during the translation which has led to disastrous outcomes.\nComing to our own Indian texts. I am going to explain the importance (of the Hindu texts as I do not see myself worthy to comment on other Indian texts )from an Indian point of view and not an outsider. But before that we need to understand what our texts are really about.\nLet's check the classification for the Hindu texts first. It would not be wrong to claim that India is a treasure-house of literature. I will try covering all types of texts - spiritual, religious, literature etc, but may still miss some. Do comment if I go wrong or miss something.\nThe Hindu texts can be widely divided as being sacred and secular. Hindus have six main classes of sacred scriptures - (i) Srutis (ii) Smritis (iii) Itihasa (iv) Puranas (v) Agamas and (vi) Darshanas. There are also four secular scriptures - (i) Subhashitas (ii) Kavyas (iii)Natakas and (iv) Alankaras.\nI have tried to provide the classifications, divisions and short commentary on the Hindu texts to keep the answer short. Please let me know in the comments if you need this in details.\nSacred Scriptures -\nI have tried my best to give you a quick glimpse into the vast stores of texts that our ancestors left for us. Some of the above referred texts may be seen as mythology, but for us it is the collective wisdom of our ancestors. There is boundless knowledge and wisdom trapped in those works. Only those who seek the knowledge within, with faith in them can unravel the mysteries.\nIf we discard them as mere mythology, we also deny the knowledge in them. The idea and knowledge within is same for the atheist and a believer. The believer acknowledges the wisdom while an atheist may discard it because the text talks in term of a supreme power.", "Yes, we should definitely read mythological texts. Because it can show the fact of life and we should learn to read this Tv shows are not life's fact. We need to read this because we need to change our mentality about abroad is not our culture. Which is shown on television that is not the fact that is only for entertaining us. When we read this book then we can know about our own culture and could behave like a civilised person. When we read it carefully then we learn about religion or wrong or right. And mainly we learn about that parent service is the best religion. and then we can learn how to manage our many problems or how should we behave with our friends or our parents, or our elders. And more things we can learn from mythological texts. So we should read this and follow it with the service of our parents.", "At the outset let me state that there is no mythological texts. The Puranas and Itihasas are not any mythology of magic or history of kings, queens, helmsmen. Puranas, Upanishads and Itihasas are technical commentaries on the Vedas. These commentaries are written by ancient intellectuals in the form of anecdotes, metaphors and other short stories mainly to educate the masses for easy understanding of the abstract Tatwams of the Vedas.\nTherefore when we read these texts we start learning about various values, wisdom, life, science, process of cleansing our mind and intellect and finally to realise the Supreme Being within ourselves.", "This is basic, just when you born, you must call, aai, or mamma,\nThen your progess starts.\nDont know you believe in purana,\nBut it is stated that, first life started in water, before 15000 years,\nand before 150 years, the evolution study by Dorvin, also conform it.", "Because it leads towards the door of spirituality.\nand a better question would be why should be inclined towards spirituality?\nIncase that's your query let me know.", "Just to understand all of them are not mythological stories , some of which are genuine.", "One chapter from my book that will be helpful:\n\u201cWe observe that in history, everything from social issues, political situations, and economic status is covered. History is factual and based on a firm foundation of proof. Even when different historians have distinct opinions about debatable points, history is orderly and objective. Myths, on the other hand, are seldom factual. These are mostly restatements of legends. Many of them relate only to a certain culture and many stories around the same myth are usually in circulation in different societies and countries. Similarities between myths, such as the ones around the great flood, show that they also highlight problems that different cultures faced in daily life. As such, myths are not only subjective stories in the words or imaginations of individuals but are also mere embroidered refinements of facts. Therefore, though myths may not be historically accurate, they are nevertheless a part of history.\nI, however, strongly believe that both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata are historically real and that the stories are woven around Lord Rama or Krishna took place, though these may have been distorted somewhat to suit the imagination of the storyteller. It is quite possible that the bridge to Lanka was in fact actually built by an army of Vanaras for Lord Rama; the Pandavas and Kauravas do exist, and if that is so, then the story of Rama and Ravana, the demon king\u2019s fight is also real as is the account of the dispute between two branches of the same family. And as far as the weapons are concerned, these might be the highly developed technologies and may have been interpreted as some kind of divine weapons by the simple people of that time. That is why; events of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata appear highly exaggerated as works of fiction.\nTherefore, we don\u2019t know how much of the stories are true and how much of them are false.\nHowever, millions of Hindus including me believe these stories and follow the ideals shown by Lord Rama and Lord Krishna. Such a belief has created the common Indian values which have been instrumental in keeping Indian society united and grounded. They are the roots of our customs and our traditions,\u201d concluded the Professor.\n\u201cIf you agree to the story of the existence of the lost city of Atlantis, then you must also acknowledge the lost city of Dwarka,\u201d Major Aarti said. \u201cOr if you believe in the existence of\nNoah, then you must agree to the existence of Manu and the Matsya Avatar, the incarnation of Lord Vishnu.\u201d\n\u201cIn my opinion, we should be giving importance to the object or the essence and not to the subject. The events described in the epics should not be taken literally but should be interpreted in the form of symbols or metaphors. One should try to look beyond the words and try to read between the lines,\u201d Professor Gaekwad clarified.\n\u201cBut what is the authenticity of those facts? How can one prove that they happened?\u201d Brandon queried.\n\u201cWhen it comes to testing the authenticity of events, one should read the Vaimanika Shastra, a Sanskrit text on aerospace technology that claims that the aerial vehicles described in the Puranic texts are real. This is one of the many texts out there that support the actual occurrence of events.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you believe that Pythagoras\u2019 theorem is true? Or why do you believe that the sum of the three interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees? Because we can very well prove them. If we cannot prove them, we treat them as myths. Similarly, we can prove that the Mahabharata events were factual using a set of archaeological and logical evidence. For instance, Krishna\u2019s legendary city of Dwarka mentioned in the Mahabharata has been discovered beneath the Gulf of Cambay in the Arabian Sea. The ruins are the same as the description provided in the epic. The hints of ancient flying aircraft called Vimanas in the Mahabharata have been discovered at several places across the globe,\u201d said the Professor.\nFor more please read the book \u201cSignboard at Dholavira\u201d\nFollow me on: Nishith S.

Knowing the research that goes into his books I was surprised to read that the Roman emperor Constantine was, with others, the designer of the religion. How it should work, who should be in charge, how will it grow, how it will be spread, how will it be enforced to frighten people in to buying the concept etcs? So I looked it up.

They both gave me pause but I think it's the fact that I read them both within a few weeks of each other that has had me pondering them ever since.\nThe first comes from an espionage thriller; John le Carre's recent novel A Legacy Of Spies. When the protagonist Peter Guillam tracks down his old mentor George Smiley and they discuss a dark operation from their past, Smiley say's the following\u2026\n\u201cWe were not pitiless, Peter. We were never pitiless. We had the larger pity. Arguably, it was misplaced. Certainly it was futile. We know that now. We did not know it then.\u201d\nI think it moved me because of the recent announcement of a peace treaty between the United States and the Taliban. Having served there as a Royal Marine many years ago I had been contemplating what if anything we had achieved there, and at what cost, and for what reasons.\nThe second passage comes from high fantasy, Tolkien infact.

He deserves death.\nDeserves death! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some die that deserve life. Can you give that to them? Then be not too eager to deal out death in the name of justice, fearing for your own safety.

All inspired by God. So in Genesis ch. 1\u201320 you not only have literally how the earth and universe was started, you see the fall of man, some judgment and how they were scattered all over the earth. The Old Testament also shows how the nation of Israel was created, and that God chose them as his special people. There were Judges, then kings, a lot of history with some interesting characters along the way. Some books get into a lot of chronology, I suggest skipping them. In fact after reading Genesis 1\u201320 or so you may as well move on to the New Testament and read the Gospel of John, Acts, and Romans. This will show you how Jesus gave himself in our place and how you can get saved.\nThen you will find many letters to the churches by Paul, God\u2019s apostle to the Gentiles. Peter, James, and John also have some letters as well, Jude, etc. Revelation is complex, and ties in with the book of Daniel, giving many end-time prophecies. That is a short overview. Blessings as you read. Always ask God to help you understand what you reading.\nHow to Read the Bible: The Beginner's Guide to Reading the Bible", "There are two divisions of the Bible: the Old Testament (written from about 1450\u2013400 B.C.). and the New Testament (written from about A.D. 50\u2013100).\nA single basic thread runs through both testaments: God provides a Savior. In the Old Testament, we trace the physical ancestry of the Savior (the purpose for all the genealogies), from the first man, Adam, through his son, Seth\u2026then through Noah, Shem\u2026Abraham\u2026Isaac\u2026Jacob (Israel)\u2026David, etc.\nThen in the New Testament, the first four books (\u201cgospels\u201d) record the arrival of this Savior, His 3-year earthly ministry, His sacrificial death, resurrection, then return to Heaven, to rule as King of kings and Lord of lords. The next book, \u201cActs,\u201d is also history\u2014but, of the church\u2019s beginning and spread throughout the Roman Empire as more and more are saved \u201cby grace through faith\u201d in this Savior. The rest of the New Testament consists of letters written by Jesus\u2019 Apostles and prophets mostly to churches to instruct and encourage them (and us) to be faithful to Jesus, our Savior, all our lives. The last book contains prophecies that ultimately speak of Jesus\u2019 future return to raise all from the dead, pass judgment on everyone, eternally reward those made righteous through faith in the Savior, and eternally punish those who remained unforgiven of their sins.", "I would suggest reading the book of Luke, and perhaps Acts. The gospel of John is also easy reading.\nFor teaching I would suggest the book of Galatians (which is a letter to the church that was in Galatia) and or the 1st letter written by John (1 John).\nRemember when you are reading that those of us who believe consider that the texts you are reading are considered to be inspired by the Spirit of God.\nAlso consider that although the narratives appear to be very simple and easy, they are also very deep and profound, and every little bit rewards deep study and understanding. An old saying is that the texts are both shallow enough for a child to wade in and deep enough to drown an Elephant.\nLast but not least it is also good practice to approach the Bible while holding the hand of God so to speak. Reading the Bible is as much about self investigation and communion with the will of God as it is about anything else. If we approach the text with the ears of our heart open then we might hear our Father showing us which way He wants us to go.", "I suggest studying prophecy.

It\u2019s not black or white, it simply is. Ideally, all witches should be grey to some extent. All witches should utilize the whole spectrum of darkness and light. There\u2019s no point in defining magic as\u201dgrey\u201d if all magic is grey.\nWith that out of the way, how do you start? I would focus on understanding magical theory. There are a lot of books that can help you with that. I personally like Hands-On Chaos Magic by Andrieh Vitimus, which explains magic in a way that is comprehensive and not too difficult to understand, and works well for my practice. You\u2019re going to have to search around for whatever approach works best for you. Here\u2019s my guide to magical theory, if you\u2019re interested: Sarah McLean's answer to How do I learn real magic powers?", "You don\u2019t, because that is not a term anybody I know uses.", "The first thing you need to read is \u201cReal Magic\u201d by Irving Bonewitz. It explains how magick works without any real cultural bias.\nI assume by \u201cgrey witch\u201d you mean one willing to hurt someone if they deem it necessary. Using your abilities to curse someone is not only morally wrong, it's dangerous. There is something called the law of three in witchcraft. It means anything you do will come back to you three fold. Cursing someone usually leads to something three times as bad happening to you. Or the people around you. Really bad idea.", "\u201cHow do I become a grey witch? What are some book recommendations? How do I start practicing magic?\u201d\nHow do you become a \u201cgrey witch\u201d? The same way I would become a Sith Lord. Just start calling yourself one, and insist that others agree with you. When they don\u2019t, tell them it\u2019s your life, your choice, and that they\u2019re being intolerant. Get really emotional about it, and threaten legal action. That sort of thing.\nSome book recommendations? I\u2019d strongly suggest the Bible, but that\u2019s just me.\nAs for how you start practicing magic, I suppose you would do that the way you\u2019d practice flying, Force powers, or breathing underwater. You know\u2026the way you\u2019d practice anything else that you simply can\u2019t do. Just make something up\u2026get a stick and yell \u201cExpecto Patronum!!\u201d as you hold your stick out. But be sure to concentrate REALLY hard. Repeat this until\u2026well\u2026just keep repeating it.\nYou see, magic doesn\u2019t exist. I can stand on a cliff, and flap my arms, and claim I\u2019m practicing flying, but the only way I\u2019m leaving the ground is by jumping off that cliff, which would be a real waste of time and effort, wouldn\u2019t it?\nSame with magic.\nYou\u2019re asking how to \u201cpractice\u201d something that is impossible to do.

I can\u2019t claim to be able to fly, and then never fly, and still be believed, can I?\nForget this \u201cmagic\u201d crap; it\u2019s not real, and the only people who are doing anything close to real magic, are the ones who write books, or hold \u201cclasses\u201d; they can make your hard-earned money disappear.\nAnd that\u2019s about as \u201cmagical\u201d as it\u2019s ever going to get.", "First find someone who will take your money with a straight face.

Gray, that's good.\nWhy don't you try to get a real life? , compared to Google on your cell phone Magic looks kind of weak. Google gives me more straight answer on a subject then I can actually handle in one sitting. Witchcraft, for a much higher price never seems to quite get to the point. I'm sure you'll make a great witch. Gray. You've obviously given this a lot of thought.", "One of the first things that I teach students who come to me is that the hardest thing to get past in magick is the idea of good and bad. Those concepts exist based on individual or group perspective. A magical practitioner does not see the world in concepts of good and evil, but in constructive and destructive - forces which are two sides of the same coin. Construction is needed for growth, but without destruction there would be no place for new things to be constructed. So when you use the term grey witch, I assume you want to be a practitioner who walks both the light and the dark paths\u2026essentially that is every witch - or at least it should be, in my opinion.\nAs to how you start practicing magick, I would suggest you begin with a thorough study of the Four Elements (don\u2019t worry about the 5th element of spirit at the moment), Astrology and Numerology before you start dealing with any type of spellwork. The Elements themselves are the single most important concept to understand. And by studying, I mean really delving deep into it. Not just that there is Earth, Air, Fire and Water, but understand what they represent, how they manifest in the physical world in all their varieties and combinations. Truly work to understand it, because after over 30 years of being a teacher I still find new insights when I meditate on them.\nOver the last 3 decades, there has been a sharp decline in the number of teaching groups/circles that are led by a trained and initiated person. These have been replaced by learning circles that are led by a group of people who are all studying/learning at various levels without any guidance or end goal in sight. This is sad because without a structured course of learning, the progress is slow at best and non-existent at worst.\nI am currently working on a video series called The Neophytes, which will show a handful of new students coming in to my coven and how they progress through the training. I have also begun a course on the Tarot which is available to view for free online at:\nI wish you luck in your search and your studies. Be vigilant.

Yes, they are all cliched - or to use another word, they\u2019re derivative, meaning they pull from an already successful author\u2019s book structure.\nAs someone who was a bookseller for years, I can say this is the reason: the publishers want an automatic audience for automatic profit. So they prefer something derivative, similar to an already successful author\u2019s writing.\nWhich means it\u2019s difficult to sell them anything really new. They also prefer a series - consider what\u2019s happened to YA fantasy since the Potter books. Think of the Star Wars franchise - after Timothy Zahn\u2019s fine initial trilogy, everything has been handed out to a series of authors - some much better than others. Publishers used to ignore YA as a money market, but no longer.\nIt\u2019s about more guaranteed profit. Sadly it\u2019s the same with adult fiction - most of it is derivative, little of it is original.\nIf you want a really first rate YA author, read Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s YA books, starting with Meet the Austins, a series that concludes with Ring of Endless Light, which in my opinion is better than Wrinke in Time and one of the finest books I\u2019ve ever read. Adults need to read it.\nAnd the separate series that begins with Arm of the Starfish. She has other individual titles as well. Check Amazon or GoodReads for titles and reviews.\nAlso if you haven\u2019t seen them, any of Chris Crutcher\u2019s books: Stotan!, Staying Fat for Sarah Burns, Iron Man, Chinese Handcuffs - they deal with very serious situations teens find themselves in.

There were probably no more than 20,000.\nThis is as nothing compared to what the City could accommodate.\nWhen reinforcements of 3000 men enter through the gate, people were waiting for ten times this, implying that the City could accommodate tens of thousands of soldiers in addition to local defenders. That is just soldiers, not civilians.\nMinas Tirith was very big, very very big. The Minas Tirith of the film, although tall, it\u2019smuch smaller, the original of the book was vaster and more splendid than anything that Pippin had dreamed. The Ring of Isengard was a mile in diameter (2 sq km), Minas Tirith was greater and stronger than Isengard. It could be two or three miles long in its seven levels built at great heights that were tapering.\nAn city of great proportions, the largest among Men of Third Age would accommodate at least 100,000. In addition, in the Pelennor fields there were many orchards, townlands and homesteads, although most of the people lived within the city.\nThe townlands were rich, with wide tilth and many orchards, and homesteads there were with oast and garner, fold and byre, and many rills rippling through the green from the highlands down to Anduin. Yet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not many, and the most part of the people of Gondor lived in the seven circles of the City, or in the high vales of the mountain-borders, in Lossarnach, or further south in fair Lebennin with its five swift streams.\nAnd in the south there was the port of Harlond.\nThere Anduin, going in a wide knee about the hills of Emyn Arnen in South Ithilien, bent sharply west, and the out-wall rose upon its very brink; and beneath it lay the quays and landings of the Harlond for craft that came upstream from the southern fiefs.\nAlthough not necessarily in Minas Tirith, these points were adjacent and integrated with the City.", "It wasn\u2019t specified plus the majority of the women, children and elderly were evacuated before Pipin and Gandalf appeared, save ofcourse to the healers. Bergil was one of the few children that were left inside Minas Tirith, during the siedge.\nHowever Pipin sees visible signs of long time decreasing population.", "Tolkien never said, and it would be hard to tell, as the majority of the non-fighting population was evacuated when Gandalf and Pippin arrived. Possibly at its height it was as populous as Rome, but Gondor had been in decline for many years.", "Impossible to say. Tolkien never gave any indication of any populations. The only possible clue is by looking at army sizes.\nDuring the chapter The Last Debate, we are given the following facts:\nOnly 4,000 Riders of Rohan are left out of the 6,000 Theoden led to battle the previous day: a 33% casualty rate in a single day\u2019s battle. (Casualties include wounded as well as killed). \u00c9omer agrees to lead 1,000 of them himself with Aragorn to the Black Gate, and send the other 3,000 north to defend the West Road.\nAragorn has 2,000 men from southern Gondor available out of the troops who sailed up the Anduin with him in the Corsair ships.\nThere are 3,500 soldiers of Gondor available under the leadership of Prince Imrahil (who is standing in for Steward Faramir) \u2014 these are the people who defended Minas Tirith during the siege. If we assume they also suffered 33% casualties during the battle, then Minas Tirith started out with 5,200 defenders.\nFinally, there are 500 horsemen including the Rangers of the North and the Knights of Dol Amroth\nTotal army under Aragorn, \u00c9omer and Imrahil: 7,000 (1,000 Rohirrim, 6,000 Gondorians).\nThere are 4,000 soldiers of Gondor marching up from the south as reinforcements, plus an unspecified number coming by ship. Aragorn states that once they have arrived, Minas Tirith will be better defended than it was before the siege began even after his army has departed.\nIn other words, Minas Tirith was initially defended by around 5,000 or 6,000 troops before the reinforcements under Th\u00e9oden and Aragorn arrived.\nHowever, we also have to consider that these troops include the reinforcements from southern Gondor who arrived before the siege. We are given a detailed breakdown of these (because Pippin watched them arrive) and there were just under 3,000 of them. That means that the regular garrison of Minas Tirith was probably about 3,000 men.\nSome of those 3,000 were full-time professional soldiers: the Guards of the Citadel (Beregond was in the Third Company) and presumably the Rangers of Ithilien. However, I assume most of the troops were relatively recently recruited, after Sauron\u2019s first attack on Osgiliath, and Minas Tirith was a city mobilised for war. In other words, 3,000 men represents the city\u2019s maximum effort in terms of armed men, not its normal peacetime garrison.\nWhat does that say about the total population?\nDuring the First World War, France and Germany mobilised 20% or more of their entire population into the armed services. If 3,000 men is 20% of the population of Minas Tirith (which would mean virtually every able-bodied man between the ages of 16 and 40), then the city\u2019s total population would be 15,000.\nHowever, it would be very difficult to sustain such a high percentage of the people under arms without modern agricultural and transport methods, at least for more than a few weeks before they had to go back to their farms. If Minas Tirith mobilised a more reasonable 10%, then its population would be 30,000. If they only managed 5% under arms, then the city would have had 60,000 people.\nNote that this would be both the population of the city itself within the walls plus, presumably, those living in the farming settlements within the Pelennor.\nSo, as a rough estimate, the population of Minas Tirith and its immediate surrounding hinterland was in the region of 15,000 to 60,000 people.\nTo put that into context, in the year 1000 CE (during the late Anglo-Saxon period in England) these were the 25 largest cities in Europe:\nConstantinople (Byzantine Empire): 150,000\nC\u00f3rdoba (Islamic Spain): 110,000\nPalermo (Sicily): 60,000\nSeville (Islamic Spain): 52,000\nSalerno (Italy): 50,000\nVenice (Italy): 50,000\nKiev (Rus\u2019): 45,000\nThessaloniki (Byzantine Empire): 45,000\nRegensburg (Holy Roman Empire): 40,000\nToledo (Islamic Spain): 37,000\nAmalfi (Italy): 35,000\nRome (Italy): 35,000\nMilan (Italy): 35,000\nMainz (Holy Roman Empire): 30,000\nNaples (Italy): 30,000\nSpeyer (Holy Roman Empire): 25,000\nLaon (France): 25,000\nCologne (Holy Roman Empire): 21,000\nParis (France): 20,000\nRouen (Normandy/France): 20,000\nTrier (Holy Roman Empire): 20,000\nLondon (England) 20,000\nWorms (Holy Roman Empire): 20,000\nMetz (Holy Roman Empire): 16,000\nGenoa (Italy): 15,000\nSo a Minas Tirith of that size would fit comfortably in the top 25 cities of early mediaeval Europe, but it wouldn\u2019t be the biggest. We do know, however, that it was in decline, and the population in 3019 of the Third Age was significantly less than it had been in the days of Gondor\u2019s glory.", "It\u2019s never stated clearly so one can only guess. If you guess 2500 it\u2019s as good a guess as 10,000.", "Okay. At the time of Pippin arriving the city had been emptied of women, children and elderly. Just soldiers and healers and caterers left. When Legolas and Gimli walk around the city they can see many places that clearly have not been inhabited for an extended period. So the population is less than it could be even when everyone is home. The layout of the city is in seven concentric circles. So let's estimate. The lowest circle might have say 500 people. The next one 450, the next one 400 and so on, 350, 300, 250, 200. This makes 2250. Then there are the townlands around the city, within the Rammas Echor which is where most people live. So you could at least double that. So make it roughly 5,000\u20136,000.\nAs I said, just an estimate."], "date_list": ["Apr 13, 2020", "Apr 12, 2020", "Apr 12, 2020", "Apr 12, 2020", "Apr 12, 2020", "Apr 12, 2020"], "question_author": "Jim Moore", "view_list": [0, 297, 72, 965, 47, 391]}, "638": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 3, "name_list": ["Nadia Bennett", "Sandra M Shaw", "Chris Spencer"], "question_title": "How much is a book of postage stamps?", "topic_list": ["Postage", "Philately", "Stamps", "Postage Stamps", "Collector's Items", "U.S. Postal Service", "Costs", "Reading", "Book Recommendations", "Books"], "no_of_view": "367", "create_time": "Apr 12, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["Check the post office", "A book of 1st class stamps is $11.00, 20 in a book at .55c each.", "Take the cost of an individual stamp, and multiply by the number of stamps in the book - there is no discount.

Revelation 22:18\u201319\u2026It\u2019s a serious matter! God bless!!!", "Because of the society we have today. The Bible contains Truth. And we have a society that does not want the truth. The truth is harsh, painful to accept so we try as hard to push it away.\nThe Bible has certainly been rewritten so fit the wants of this modern society. Some of us can see that the things predicted in the Bible are actually taking place, but we want to continue in our comforts in the lie. Jesus said that he came to bring light to men, but man loves darkness.\nModern Christianity ( churchianity) is outright lukewarm. It is really all just a big confusion, and one just needs to observe from a distance to see th lie and hypocrisy that it is. Certainly people don't mind when the Bible is changed to fit their ideas of how God must want them to be rich, prosperous, popular, healthy\u2026 Take for example the teaching that we should not judge others. It has been used to promote self love,pride and hatred. But that is not what Jesus taught, he taught people to use righteous judgement.\nDo you see how we are asleep as a society?", "your question is very vague, yes it's Rewritten but for publishing purposes. Now if you meant it's being Rewritten and its meaning is changing, you're absolutely wrong. A Bible that was written 200 years ago compared to one written two years ago the scriptures are identical in meaning, maybe the new one has a little more new language for the current generation to follow it more. But just say once again the meaning and the scriptures are the same", "I almost passed on this question, but given the answers I am seeing here I think this deserves a more serious consideration than is being given by many of the Quora contributors so far.\nFoundationally, the Bible comes to us from two sources: a Hebrew text called the \u201cMasoretic text,\u201d and a Greek text called \u201cNovum Testamentum Graece,\u201d which is a critical text assembled from the many sources of Greek writing we have to validate the text of the NT. The Masoretic Text is the oldest complete text of the Old Testament which s available to us, but we can have confidence that this text is substantially the same text, for example, that was used in Judaism at least 300 years before the birth of Christ as the scraps of tests of Jewish Scripture we have archeologically match the Masoretic Text quite well.\nEvery Bible you read today effectively uses these source texts to make their translations. It is a made-up story that somehow the Bible you have in English or German or Chinese or Hindi is somehow a shadow of the original text because it comes to you through a strange game of \u201ctelephone\u201d in which the original text is translated into language 1, then language 2, then language 3, and so forth until it comes to you in modern form in a modern language.\nWhat is, I think, confusing for most people, is that, especially in English, there is a ridiculous number of variant translations. The last time I checked I think there were 80 distinct translations into English. Rather than investigate all the reasons for all the various committees and motives to put the Bible into English, let\u2019s think about only one of the reasons: theories of translation.\nWherever anything is translated from one language to another, the translator has to make a choice: will I attempt to translate all the words as strictly as possible, or will I attempt to translate the meaning of the words and phrases as accurately as possible? The former philosophy of translation is called \u201cword for word\u201d translation, the latter is called \u201cdynamic\u201d translation.\nIt\u2019s completely true that there are very avid defenders of both ends of the spectrum for philosophy, but it is also true that the many translations you can find of the Bible exist on a spectrum from wooden/literal (where every word is slavishly translated) to paraphrase/dynamic (in which almost no word is translated exactly and the translator has taken liberty with the text to insert his own impressions and thoughts into the text).\nThe most sadly-untrue thing I have read in the competing answers to this question is the idea that somehow Protestants rewrite the Bible when they disagree with it. Suffice it to say that the Catholic church hardly has one translation which they use without any alternatives, and those Bible also run the gamut from hyper-literal to paraphrase.\nHope this helps.", "It is not rewritten except for versions that are written to deceive us.\nVersions like the free ISR are continuously updated as new information is validated and are continually scrutinised by experts, world wide.", "They are not being rewritten as in changed each year. They can be updated due to language change, new manuscripts discovered and such. Now Bias in translating has existed for a long time which can be seen in just about every translation. In some cases the bias ignores grammar as in most popular Bibles.", "Many Protestants follow the tradition set by Martin Luther - If the Bible disagrees with your bdliefs, then change it.\nDrop some books, drop lines out of others, add a word here and there.\nOthers want it to be more invlusive/politically correct - change Father to Parent; change Men to People or to Men And Women.\nSometimes -but not often- there is a scholarly reinterpretation of a word or phrase (for example \u201cinkeeper\u201d from \u2018 no room in the inn\u2019 actually means \u201ckeeper of the upper level\u201d and referred to the matriarch of the family who assigned sleeping spaces to family and guests. in this case she probably said something akin to \u201cMary, your\u2019e about to have your baby, I am putting you where we keep the fresh hay for some privacy\u201d.) There are serious problems when reading a flowery Old English translation of ancient Hebrew, Greek, and Latin documents.", "Not rewritten, Just better translations from older found manuscripts between Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic", "It\u2019s not being \u201crewritten\u201d. There are different styles of translation. Some translations are more literal, word-for-word translations, and some are more thought-for-thought translations. And as the English language evolves, the becomes the need for new translations to keep up with the current English language.

The upending of the fundamental goal of mathematics, that everything can be proven if you just know enough, was upset in the mid-1930s by the likes of Goedel, Turing, Church, Post, and a host of others who proved that all mathematical systems are incomplete. Thus, dashing the hopes of those who thought that if you could just write a treaty in the first-order predicate calculus, you could always prove a violation or compliance. John Campbell wrote of giant airplanes with propeller blades measure hundreds to thousands of feet. He didn\u2019t take into account that a fraction of the distance out from the blades, the velocity of the blade would be supersonic. The blade would tear itself apart from the stresses. Don\u2019t focus on the technology, and don\u2019t try to supersize it. And note that if you were writing cellphones into your stories in the 1950s, the stories would have been absurd, because nobody could make a personal communicator with worldwide access that you could carry in your pocket. Don\u2019t be ridiculous! Why, the infrastructure alone would cost billions of dollars! (Oh, wait. It does. That didn\u2019t stop Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and others from building multibillion-dollar infrastructures.)\nIt is far more interesting to study the impact of something new on society, usually by studying one to six people in that society.", "There\u2019s a lot of mistakes you can make, but most of them are general to writing, fiction, and genre writing.\nThe potholes of science fiction lie right in the name. It has science. And it has fiction about science, which usually implies world-building.\nI\u2019ll hit the science first. Not all of these are fatal problems; good books have been written that commit everything on this list (possibly all of them at once):\nGetting science wrong. Science fiction readers are an educated bunch and many of them are nerdy about science. They not only know how things work, they care. They\u2019ll forgive the necessary weasels; put in faster-than-light travel all you like because even though you can\u2019t science it, the story can really slow down without it. But they will not forgive basic mistakes, even if they don\u2019t impact the plot in any way.\nBeing unfamiliar with the field. Science marches on, and so does science fiction. Science fiction has a history, and it has fads. Few things (outside of bad science) annoy the science fiction reader more than an outsider to the field popping up with AI or human cloning or something and going on like it is the most amazing new idea ever.\nBeing too familiar with the field \u2014 or rather, the wrong part of the field. You can get away with cut-and-pasting the \u201cscience\u201d (hah!) of Star Wars and Star Trek, by which I mean inserting the words \u201ctransporter\u201d and \u201chyperspace\u201d and so on everywhere and think you are doing science fiction. You aren\u2019t, really. The core SF fans will hate it. Fortunately for you, there is a whole audience out there who doesn\u2019t know any better, either.\nThings go out of fashion in SF. Science marches on. You can get away with magic nanotech on the fringes but the core readership will point you at more recent writer with a more up-to-date understanding. And save your humid jungles of Venus for a consciously retro pastiche.\nWriting only for the core. What did I say above? Get everything right, be too familiar with what is being done and has been done, and you risk a book that the larger potential audience, that audience who saw Star Wars but has never picked up a book before will be unable to understand. Try not to hit them with the transuranics and the bussard ramscoops right there on the first page.\nUnless your name is James Tiptree. Tip, PKD, and several other writers past and present, could pull off the trick of dumping a reader in the middle of a world that seemed entirely beyond their comprehension and yet make them enjoy it. No, I don\u2019t know what the trick is. Go ask Alice.\nAnd that was a whole bunch of stuff. Sorry. The flip side is the world-building. Which might just be The Machine that Changes Everything, or it could be what society looks like in a hollowed-out asteroid on a transtellar journey five thousand years in the future.\nWorld-building is fun. Explaining your world to the reader is not.\nAnd here\u2019s my particular take. It can\u2019t be done perfectly. Sure, there are lists and lists about what you shouldn\u2019t do. Don\u2019t have a Watson, don\u2019t do Maid-and-Butler, avoid As You Know Bob, etc., etc. And then comes a Jack Vance who does a footnote longer than the page it started on.\nThere are ways of making the background slide into the reader\u2019s consciousness more smoothly. But when all is said and done, it will be awkward. Or it will be left out. Pretty much you are left with four options:\nJust don\u2019t explain. Pick a world which you don\u2019t have to describe. \u201cSociety fell and mumble mumble nanotechnology now it looks just like The Three Musketeers, only with laser swords. Or write a story in which the only science-fictional element is a flying car found in a garage and nobody ever figures out where it came from or how it flies.\nJust get it over with. As You Know Bob, or just hijack the narrative yourself, until the reader is up to speed. Try not to David Weber Orders a Pizza about it, but just grit teeth and get through it. The reader knows what you are up against and will permit it. Just keep it short and get it out of the way as soon as possible.\nDo a big Encyclopedia Galactica or an Obvious Watson but frost it up with added chocolate sprinkles so it is just amusing enough the reader will allow you to get away with it anyhow.\nDo all of the above. Hide as much of the world as you can, or at least delay how the Star Drive works until someone actually has to repair it. Figure out what actually matters to the plot and prioritize that. Don\u2019t explain because you know it, explain because the reader needs to know it.\nUse every trick to try to subtle it in. Get the reader involved in the struggle to defuse a bomb and they almost don\u2019t notice they got a pop quiz on the Island of Stability in the middle of it. Have a Watson who is competent and interesting and doesn\u2019t just sit there going, \u201cGosh, Holmes, so that\u2019s how robots work! I would have never imagined!\u201d\nAnd when there is something you can\u2019t get to elegantly, something the reader really does need to know and explaining it with a scene or dialog would slow down the action too much, then just do it. Be like a stage hand; just walk out there, prop the wall back up, then duck back out of sight. The audience will forgive you and, in a moment, will be absorbed in the action of the play once more.\nAnd can I mention I really hate the auto-list function? It makes it impossible to construct proper paragraphs.", "I think the biggest mistake in a science fiction novel is not adding dystopian elements. The two genres fit so well together!

Then, too, it can depend on the quality of the stone: higher quality limestone will withstand more.\nIt could be related to socio-economic factors. If the family of the deceased who paid for that headstone were wealthy enough to afford high quality material, they could also (presumably) afford higher quality carving. The letters will have been engraved much deeper, making it harder for the surface to weather down to their level. They may also have been picked out in paint or gold leaf, which would not only withstand the weathering better by itself but will also protect the stone it covers.\nThe nature of the grave site also plays it's part. A well tended grave is less likely to be attacked by climbing plants such as ivy which would damage the surface of the stone.

How Shelob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out of the Dark Years few tales have come. But still she was there, who was there before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-dur; and she served none but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness.

Instead, the book helps me build up the ideas that I have such strong belief in.\nI guess I will not try to summarize the book too much here, as you can easily look it up on Google and find an amazing description of it. (By the way, it is 100% through Google). It is about a young boy called Dorian, who, much like the mythical character Narcissus, becomes encapsulated with his outstanding physical beauty. He falls into the cunning of one Lord Henry and is extremely jealous of a portrait of himself painted by an amazing artist and close friend Basil Hallworth. As he moves into his decline of beauty and advances in the pursuit of personal pleasure aided by Lord Henry, he finds that the portrait takes on ugliness, age, and physical wear, while he remains untouched throughout the years. Corrupt, he commits a series of despicable deeds without suffering any repercussions, at least physically, but the rest of his life begins to fall around him.\nIt has been an amazing experience and I would strongly recommend this book as a sort of experimental reading.

Moreover, the E-book just click, but who knows when to read it \ud83d\ude48\nSo, this book is very neat in my opinion. Frankl was a psychiatrist who had been a Nazi prisoner in the Hitler era for three years.\nIn this book, he told his experience of describing the lives of prisoners in a concentration camp. I even shuddered while visualizing in my mind. Imagine how they worked in the cold snow, barefoot walking on ice because their shoes would no longer fit. In tattered clothes.\nHow do most of them wish it would be better to die than live in hell like that time. How can they guess the rest of their colleague's life and get used to seeing death every day. And live in the shadow of fear that they could have been sent to the gas chamber at any time to be destroyed.\nAccording to Frankl, the average surviving prisoners who have been moved from one camp to another are those who have lost all ethics for survival. From how honest or not, brutal to betray their own friends for survival.\nAnd Frankl found a way to survive differently, without losing his human side. Not survive in a physical sense, but survive psychologically. Find a way to be always optimistic even at the lowest point in life.\n\u201cSuffering really has no meaning, it is we who give meaning to suffering through the way we deal with it\u201d\nMany quotes that hit me, it's just that I will not write it here because it will be a very long writing.\nWhat I found from this book is that there is a greater meaning than happiness, which is the meaning of life itself.\nFor example, we consider happiness when we can find an extraordinary life partner. Or happy is when we can be accepted to work in the company that we have been dreaming of.\nBut it turns out that when our spouse turns out to have a lot of bad sides that are only seen lately, or it turns out co-workers or leaders in the company where we work is very annoying. Then the meaning of happiness can be changed from initial expectations, and result in deep disappointment. Though all returned how do we disclose it.\nThis is called stimulus-response. There are many things that we cannot change, but we can choose how we disclose them.\nJust as Frankl and the other prisoners felt, even in conditions that felt like hell, they tried to find and find a little happiness from a sense of humor and art.\n\u201cLikewise with suffering, He will fill man's soul and conscious mind, regardless of the size and size of suffering. Therefore the \"measure\" of human suffering is relative. Correspondingly, even trivial things can provide enormous happiness\u201d.

People like different stuff.\nI get the idea that books like Action #1 and Detective #27 are the most wanted\u2026I think that\u2019s somewhat true but I also think a big driving force is the idea of getting those books and reselling them. Or rather, the driving force is the fact that they\u2019re practically unobtainable for most people. When you get more realistic and focus on comics worth less than $1000, you start to see a desire for comics that more closely resemble people\u2019s tastes. I know Action Comics #1 is seen as the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d\u2026I also know how many fans couldn\u2019t care less about Superman because they find him boring.\nSo whether it\u2019s the comic that\u2019s popular or the idea of what the comic is\u2026I think a lot of people\u2019s most wanted comics right now are that key issue from a run they\u2019re trying to complete.

I gather SILE - What is SILE?\nis a modern revamp of TeX, using the same basic algorithms. A lesser known system was the Lout\nsystem created by Jeff Kingston of Sydney\u2019s Basser Dept of Computer Science.\nTeX I think made an attempt to avoid \u2018rivers\u2019: apparent runs of white space due to chance alignment of spaces through lines of text.

The consequence is that if you change the layout (such as if you produce different editions with different font or page sizes, or if you\u2019re producing an ebook edition in which the user can change the layout at their whim), that per-page manual assessment and adjustment needs to be done again, quite likely across the entire book.\nI don\u2019t know whether any programs attempt to build-in the automated application of such aesthetic typography adjustments.

Flashes emit a bio-electric aura through the speed force that negates friction on anything they are carrying. I found the pages online of Bart actually pulling off this incredible act of speed reading:\nAs you can see, books moving faster than the eye can see. No flames.

From what we know of the fictional character, he doesn\u2019t have a photographic memory and much of what he reads would be forgotten not long afterwards because of the new information coming in from the next books he read. A lot of fictional books basically have the same general plot and storyline and would blur together. Factual books would become repetitive because different authors write about the same facts, and the only difference is the amount of data included as well as the point of view or perspective brought to the treatment of the data. (Yes, even data can be slanted according to the author\u2019s biases.)\nThe main point would be, Why? Why would he want to read all the books in the world? I, for one, wouldn\u2019t devote any time at all to law books because I find them horrendously boring. Others would adore them. To each their own.

That's interesting, but what is a real meaning of helicopter money?\nThe term helicopter money came about because it represents the concept of the country\u2019s central bank creating free money and giving it directly to individuals and businesses. Currently in U.S., the Federal Reserve provides monetary stimulus by injecting reserves into the financial system with the goal financial institutions would lend us money out to businesses and the ultimate goal of creating spending. It appears that existing monetary policy has not worked very effectively in this economic recovery because financial institutions still have large cash balances in the federal reserve accounts and spending has remained muted by historical standards.\nThat is true. As a result the idea has been thrown out that the Federal Reserve should simply create cash deposited directly into individuals and businesses accounts with the belief that the money would be spent and help stimulate the economy.\nIt is the financial equivalent of the Federal Reserve dropping cash from a helicopter. Unfortunately, that may sound like a great concept, but it's not that simple. The Federal Reserve conducts their monetary policy by buying or selling US government securities. If they want to stimulate the economy their authority to buy US government securities and credit the reserve accounts of member financial institutions. That's what happened during their quantitative easing operations.\nThe Federal Reserve does not have the mechanism to deposit money directly into consumer business accounts and it's questionable if they have the authority to simply print money. Congress has the authority to pass legislation that would authorize the U.S. treasurer to issue checks or electronic deposits to individuals. This occurred during the last recession when congress authorized the US Treasury to send checks to qualifying individuals.\nThe problem is that this would balloon the deficit. The reason that proponents suggest helicopter money originating from the Federal Reserve is because creation of money by the Federal Reserve does not increase the deficit. As mentioned earlier how the federal reserve and get this money to individuals and businesses is not clear at all. And don't forget that giving free money is not actually free. Otherwise all countries would be doing this. All else being equal giving free money to individuals and businesses via the Federal Reserve printing money would ultimately lead to higher inflation.\nFixed income investors would demand a higher yield for bonds if they believe that inflation or debt problems would result and this would cause bond prices to fall. Higher bond yields would then drive borrowing costs up for individuals and businesses with the potential unintended consequence that they cut back on spending.\nThere are also two other risk to consider. First consumers might not spend the money, simply put into savings. As we saw with the temporary tax cut that occurred during the recession not all of that money was actually spent. Second this is something that has never been tried and it would be a giant economic laboratory experiment with actual results unknown.\nI would simply remind all that the age-old adage still applies.

There isn\u2019t a rule, but roughly 50+ years, enough to clearly differentiate \u201cthe present\u201d from the period in which the novel takes place. But from that, you can have romances, thrillers, war stories, mysteries, etc. The expectation is that while the core story is fictional the setting is clearly recognizable for the period in which it\u2019s set, historical figures may appear and play greater or lesser roles and technology needs to hew to that available in that time period. A woman in a writer\u2019s workshop I\u2019ve attended is doing a novel in the years after the First Fleet\u2019s arrival in Australia. Historical and fictional characters interact. In such cases, while the author can invent events for the historical figures to participate in, where we have documentation about what they did these novels need to remain consistent. Captain Arthur Philip was governor in Australia from 1788\u20131792, and eventually died in Bath, England, in 1814. Historical fiction needs to hew to those, although it can certainly imagine what he may have done on the times we know he was somewhere, but have no record of precisely what he\u2019d done or encountered.\nIf you want to ignore fidelity to history, \u201cAlternate history\u201d is a common term for fiction novels that are based around actual historical events but posit some aspect of the actual historical record changed. For example, \u201cHow Few Remain,\u201d by Harry Turtledove, posits a series of events that allowed the South to achieve enough of a stalemate in the US Civil War to cement their independence to split the United States. A series of books, under the series title \u201cSouthern Victory,\u201d then follows this alternative timeline into the 20th Century. At the beginning, the major historical figures are all historical, e.g., Generals Robert E. Lee of the south and George McLellan of the north, President Abraham Lincoln and more. As the novels move in time more historical figures appear, such as George Patton.\nAlthough Turtledove wrote many alternate history novels and series with science fictional / fantastic events, \u201cHow Few Remain\u201d is purely based in a reimagined timeline. Thus, ensuing development of both the North American continent from 1863 as well as world history is affected, but it\u2019s all based in known science. For science fiction, his \u201cThe Guns of the South\u201d reimagines white supremacist South Africans time traveling back to the US Civil War to provide the south with AK47s. \u201cWorldwar\u201d imagines an alien invasion in the middle of World War II and how it affects the world. Both of these series again use historical settings and figures as they existed. Naturally, many other characters are fictional, especially many viewpoint characters. But that makes these books \u201cscience fiction + alternate history.\u201d\nIf you want to relatively accurate to history but mess around with something big, like the available technology, you can get \u201csteampunk\u201d, a sub-genre of science fiction, not historical fiction. These are set mainly in relatively accurate Victorian Era (late 18th Century) settings except for various sorts of advanced technology, e.g., airships, weaponry, aliens and other specific items. But clothing, mores, countries, etc., are distinctly to that era.\nThe other answer mentions Dan Brown\u2019s books, such as \u201cThe Da Vinci Code.\u201d This doesn\u2019t so much change history as it tries to reinterpret it by making assertions about key events that are unknown or are unconventional analysis. Brown\u2019s books then are more \u201cthrillers\u201d than alternate history (IMHO).\nThere are also many novels that don\u2019t change history but use realistic historical settings for a \u2018time travel\u2019 fictional story. A couple of examples are \u201cDoomsday Book\u201d by Connie Willis and \u201cTimeline\u201d by Michael Crichton. Both are built around time travellers from current times (20th, early 21st century) visiting England during the Black Death (1348\u20131352) to study it. Although various local events are affected, by and large there is no macro change to the historical timelines from the actions by the characters. Various historical figures of the time are referred to but generally don\u2019t play major parts. After all, not that many \u2018regular\u2019 people (that the time travellers\u2019 posed as) spent time hanging out with kings. These would both simply be \u201cscience fiction\u201d as they don\u2019t alter history, but the settings are realistic to the actual history of the period, at least so far as historians have been able to reconstruct it but the technology that sets it up, time travel, is beyond existing science so I don\u2019t consider these historical fiction.", "Yes", "(Details included in answer)\nNot historical fiction, but thrillers, mysteries, etc, taking place within a contemporary period but in which history plays an important part in the plot.\nDan Brown, say.

But there are a lot of differences between what 3b1b can do in an online video, and what a teacher can do in a classroom with a blackboard.\n3b1b uses animations, and this is a great source for visual insights. But you simply cannot replicate this on a blackboard or a textbook page. Some textbooks have QR codes or links that lead to a website with a cool animation or some interactive app. Myself, I plug my tablet into the projector to show the class gifs, Desmos, videos, etc. Sometimes I literally show 3b1b\u2019s videos in my classroom. But students tend to roll their eyes when the prof shows a video/animation in class, even one he made on his own (I\u2019ve done it myself). Either way, this is no substitute for the the fluid animations that online videos can include.\nYou can watch 3b1b at your own pace, and even rewind to catch tidbits you might\u2019ve missed. This is impossible in a physical classroom \u2014 the best you can do is ask the prof to repeat, but many students are embarrassed to do this, and certainly it comes at the cost of slowing the lecture down. And you definitely can\u2019t pause the prof for a lunch break.\nBy simply clicking a 3b1b video, you have already fully bought into the fact that you\u2019re about to learn something. This is totally different than dragging yourself out of bed for an 8:30am sixty-minute lecture on technical test material, even if the prof is a badass teaching robot who shows you cool animations and pictures. But technical material *is* important (see my next point).\n3b1b highlights concepts and visual understanding, and this is EXTREMELY important for learning math \u2014 it is sorely underrepresented in classrooms. But a university classroom must also focus on developing technical skills and preparing you for tests, and this material can be dry, even with the most exciting lecturer. As boring as they are, these technical skills are important things we try to teach you in university. If 3b1b showed you a beautiful animation involving determinants and told you \u201cthere\u2019s gonna be a test, and your job prospects depend on your performance\u201d, I\u2019m sure many students would be annoyed at the lack of technical detail he shows. It\u2019s like \u201cI know *what* a determinant is, but how do I calculate the determinant of this 5x5 matrix? How do I prove that a unitary matrix has determinant +/- 1?\u201d 3b1b videos are the benchmark for high level conceptual understanding, but low level technical stuff is not equally present in his videos. (Also, I don\u2019t mean that 3b1b CAN\u2019T or SHOULD include details, just that his \u201cessence of linear algebra\u201d series tends not to, and there are pros/cons to that.)\nWith 3b1b\u2019s videos, you don\u2019t have in-class opportunities to work on exercises with your peers, or to ask the lecturer to give you immediate feedback. I usually assign group work during my lectures: because I fully understand that if students wanted to watch someone talk for an hour, they might as well watch 3b1b because he is much better than me. I love what Sanderson is doing in his recent live stream videos \u2014 his questions are designed to get you thinking and playing (many profs design similar questions), and his polls get the audience engaged in the material. Profs also use polls \u2014 ever heard of an iClicker? Ever heard of people complaining about how much they hate iClickers? I use Kahoot in my university classroom, but students always think it\u2019s fun to crash my tablet with bots. See the contradiction there?\nI love 3b1b so much. Professors need to wake up and incorporate his methods into their classrooms. But there are pros/cons to physical delivery and online delivery, and each format has different goals. You should be aware of these differences.", "It's about the building of ideas. They want you to build skills so that you can move beyond introduction to linear algebra techniques. The video shows what is going on and the teacher is thinking that is what I said.\n(ad distance in x) so forth. They do this because you should be building off the abstract ideas of distance and the area of a parallelogram. By understanding this you can move on to 3d ( 3x3 matrices) and further.\nI suspect you are most likely used to the more graphical text books. Let's sum up math texts books and the disconnect with teachers. There are two kinds.\nOne is the text book written by a Mathematics major with a minimum M.S. degree. These books written for any math below calculus becomes harder for a Mathematics major to simplify. Where addition just is for others trigonometry just is for a Mathematics major. So those books don't always work as well as people would like for undergraduate Mathematics. Beyond calculus professors use the book less anyway.\nThe other book is the large publishing company. A pretty book made by writers with a graphic artists and Mathematics consultants. The books are prettier with mathematical visuals, but there is a disconnect between the Mathematics teacher and the book as the Mathematician was more of an editor. This leaves the teacher and book at a disadvantage.", "Textbook authors and math professors very often include that pictorial intuition into their explanation of the concept of a determinant. The premise of the question is false.\nHowever, as Grant Sanderson himself points out at the end of the video, this doesn\u2019t amount to a proof of anything. Furthermore, this lovely video doesn\u2019t address determinants in higher dimensions, nor determinants over fields that don\u2019t happen to be contained in . There\u2019s a lot more that needs to be said of determinants.", "Speaking as a retired math adjunct professor of 15 years, I held all my students to the demanding standard that mastering math requires. This includes learning rigorous definitions and mastering difficult problems line by line, precept upon precept.\nI held all my students to a high, rigorous, demanding, mathematical standard. I never watered down the material to the lower standard of the students.", "I do teach this way to the best of my ability. The animations are key to the visual understanding and I create animations on my computer. I have older coworkers who do not know how to use software to make such animations. I don\u2019t know how a textbook would. I have seen some lazy textbooks and I have see some do their best.\nAnother limiting factor is time. There are many topics that I could give a very deep understanding of if I have enough time to explore them. But when you have to cover X topics in Y amount of time and the parents and kids don\u2019t care about it if it isn\u2019t on the ACT then you don\u2019t get to explore like you would like to.\nEdit: The video linked is part of a wonderful math youtube channel.

Read books that interest you.\nYou might not want to read a book that you don\u2019t like. Being interested in a topic, will probably higher the chance for you to understand texts that would normally be too difficult. You are much more likely to commit to reading when it is an enjoyable and engaging experience.\n4. Use a dictionary sensibly.\nUsing a concise dictionary when reading can assist vocabulary acquisition. Relying on it may be a big help but sometimes it slows you down so try to avoid using it regularly and use it wisely. You can also understand a word by knowing its usage and by rephrasing the sentence. Try to guess the meaning of the word and with that you don\u2019t need to look anything up.\n5. Read with purpose.\nKnow your reasons for reading. The way you read a certain text or a book depends on your reason for reading it, that\u2019s why it is important to know your reading purpose.
