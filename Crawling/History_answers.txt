They thought FDR was scheming and could not be trusted. They believed he had communist leanings as reflected by his New Deal. But he was a necessary evil. But most of all they saw him as a hypocrite.\n\u201cIt was against this backdrop that Roosevelt prepared for a confrontation on the colonial question with Churchill at the February 1943 Allied conference in Casablanca, Morocco. \u201c\n\u201cIt was apparently Roosevelt's own idea that he should make a stop in Liberia on his trip to the meeting. Roosevelt made brief public remarks highlighting the fact that Liberia had been founded by American slaves and was a free nation, but he was outraged at what he saw: substandard living conditions; he privately blamed the State Department for having no policy on economic development for Liberia or for anywhere else in the ``poor'' world, and saw this as undermining his foreign policy. \u201c\n\u201cAs embarrassed as FDR was by what he saw in Liberia, he was, according to first hand accounts, visibly shaken by what he viewed in a brief stop in British Gambia. On his arrival at Casablanca, FDR told his son:\n``The thing is, the colonial system means war. Exploit the resources of a India, a Burma, a Java, take all the wealth out of those countries, but never put anything back into them, things like education, sanitation, decent standards of living, minimum health requirements--all you are doing is storing up the kind of trouble that leads to war...I must tell Churchill what I found out about his British Gambia today.... This morning at about eight-thirty, we drove through Bathurst to the airfield. The natives were just getting to work. In rags ... glum-looking.... They [his British hosts] told us that the natives would look happier around noontime, when the sun would have burned off the dew and the chill. I was told that the prevailing wages of these men was one and nine. One shilling, nine pence. Less that fifty cents ... a day! Fifty cents a day! Besides which they are given half a cup of rice.... Dirt. Disease. Very high mortality rate. I asked life expectancy. You'd never guess what it is. Twenty six years! These people are treated worse than livestock. Their cattle live longer!... Churchill may have thought I wasn't serious last time [at Argentia]. He'll find out this time.''\n\u201cWe have some idea of what Roosevelt was saying from an account of discussions, at which Churchill was present, with the Sultan of Morocco. Roosevelt, speaking in French, stressed the need for Morocco to develop and control her own resources. To do this, he said, required: ``the elevation of the living standards of Moroccans; only by doing that could Morocco be free of imperial intrigues (Morocco was at the time controlled by the French). The Sultan expressed a desire to obtain modern education and health standards. \u201c\n``Father pointed out,'' Elliot Roosevelt wrote, ``that to accomplish this, the Sultan should not permit outside interests to obtain concessions which would drain off the country's resources.''\n\u201cChurchill was described as growing increasingly furious at these comments, and repreatedly tried to change the subject. Roosevelt persisted, telling the Sultan that the postwar world would differ sharply from the prewar world, ``especially as they related to the colonial question.'' The Sultan asked FDR what he meant by ``differ sharply.'' Roosevelt explained that in the past, French and British financiers combined into self-perpetuating syndicates for the purpose of dredging riches out of the colonies; he then said that there were likely large oil deposits in Morocco that needed development. The Sultan said, that while he would like to pursue such possibilities and use the wealth to develop his nation, he was unable to do so without going to the colonial powers, since his country lacked scientists, engineers, and technicians needed to develop a petroleum industry. Roosevelt suggested that the U.S.A. could establish a reciprocal aid program that would have as its purpose the development of skilled engineers and scientists and technicians, using American universities for the training. Roosevelt then suggested that the Sultan could engage American firms to carry out the development program he had in mind, on a fee or small percentage basis. American aid would not be exploitative, said FDR, nor would it ask for control of resources or political institutions. \u201c\n\u201cChurchill was described as ``glowering'' when he left the room.\u201c\n\u201cA year later, in a speech to the Negro News Publishers Association, Roosevelt gave additional description of the conflict with Churchill, referring to his view of colonial rule in Gambia:\n``I am taking up with Prime Minister Winston Churchill at the present time--I think that he will see the point--the general thought that the United Nations ought to have an inspection committee of all these colonies that are way, way down the line, that are not ready to have anything to say because the owning country has given them no facilities.\n``And if we send a committee from the United Nations, and I used the example of Gambia, to go down to Gambia, `If you Britishers don't come up to scratch--toe the mark--then we will let the world know.\n``Well, the Prime Minister doesn't like that idea. And his comeback was: `All right, the United Nations will send an inspection committee to your own South in America.'' (Laughter)\n``I said, `Winston, that's all right with me. Go ahead and do it. Tell the world. We call it freedom of the press, and you call it `pitiless publicity'--you can right a lot of wrong with `pitiless publicity.'|''\nThrough to the End\n\u201cRunning for an unprecedented fourth term in 1944, Roosevelt used the election campaign to educate Americans about their special responsibility in the creation of the postwar world. It is in the interest of America, he told them in several speeches, to rebuild the world in its image, to give hope and prosperity to millions. The campaign to make the world's population truly free from want, as he had promised in his Four Freedoms speech three years earlier, would mean jobs and prosperity for Americans: It was in our own best interests to see others prosper. \u201c\n\u201cSpeaking at the meeting of the International Labor Organization in May, was broadcast nationally, Roosevelt dsecribed the horrors of the British imperial system in Gambia, he said:\n``I think that we can get somewhere if we keep that idea of being `agin'--as we say in Irish-American--`against' exploitation everywhere. It would be an awfully good thing for all of us....''\n\u201cHowever, Roosevelt balked at enlisting the American people into his fight against Churchill and the British Empire. That would have to wait, he told aides, until after the war was won on the battlefields. \u201c\n\u201cThe British responded to the threat Roosevelt represented through the mouth of GOP candidate Thomas Dewey, who was controlled by John Foster Dulles. Dewey claimed that Roosevelt and the New Deal apparatus responsible for his economic proposals were ``communists'' and that Roosevelt, if elected, would turn the country over to the ``Reds.''\n\u201cChurchill, meanwhile, was prepared to stall. FDR suffered from serious heart problems and hypertension, although his own physicians thought that he could survive through a fourth term. By late 1944, Churchill was in receipt of a secret briefing on the President's health by Churchill's personal physician Lord Moran: Roosevelt had only several months to live, at best, perhaps a year. \u201c\n\u201c(It cannot be ruled out that the British may have had a direct hand in the President's deteriorating health. it is certainly the case that Churchill, through his insistence on two summits in Canada during the height of the campaign, and his delay of the proposed summit with Stalin until it required a precarious, 12,000-mile mid-winter trip to Yalta, deliberately caused strain and helped wear out Roosevelt. Doctors have since stated that the strain of the Yalta trip may have taken several months or even a year from Roosevelt's life.) \u201c\n\u201cAt Yalta in February 1945, Roosevelt continued to doggedly pursue the policies that had guided him since 1941. He sought and won from Stalin an agreement to keep China whole, to allow for a coalition government between the Communists and Chiang, and to make it one of the ``Big Four.'' He also gained specific agreement for Russian entry into the war against Japan; for Roosevelt, who was in possession of secret military briefings from MacArthur's spies in Japan, a Russian invasion of Manchuria and attacks on Korea would mean that an invasion of the Japanese mainland was not necessary. (Immediately upon his return to the United States, Roosevelt, in reviewing invasion plans, with MacArthur's full consent, put them all on hold. His son Elliot, as well as others close to him, say that FDR already believed that the military use of the atomic bomb was unncecessary to gain a victory over Japan and would have never consented to its use on populated areas.) \u201c\n\u201cRoosevelt believed that he would be personally able to force Stalin to abide by his agreements; he expressed more fear about duplicity from the British than from the Soviet leader. \u201c\n\u201cThe records of the February 1945 Yalta meeting, now public, also show that Roosevelt put on the table his plans to place the British Empire under international supervision, as a step toward dismantling it. According to Elliot Roosevelt, Churchill responded with rage:\n``I will never agree to the fumbling fingers of 40 or 50 nations prying into the existence of the British Empire.... While there is life in my body, no transfer of British sovereignty will be permitted.''\n\u201cOn Feb. 23, 1944, during his return from Yalta aboard the U.S.S. Quincy, Roosevelt held an ``off the record'' press briefing for reporters. He told them of his extraordinary plans to make the deserts bloom in the Middle East, using oil resources for vast irrigation programs. Roosevelt explained that, in his mind, this was what the new United Nations was going to be all about. \u201c\n\u201cHe then stated that he was not going to allow the French to reclaim Indochina and that Stalin and Chiang were in agreement with him:\n``With the Indo-Chinese, there is a feeling that they ought to be independent but they are not ready for it. I suggested at the time, that Indo-China be set up under trusteeship--have a Frenchman, one or two Indo-Chinese, a Chinese, and a Russian because they are on the coast, and maybe a Filipino and an American--to educate them for self-government....\n``Stalin liked the idea. Chiang liked the idea. The British don't like it. It might bust up their empire, because if the Indo-Chinese were to work together and eventually get their independence, the Burmese might do the same thing to England. The French have talked about how they expect to recapture Indo-China, but they haven't got any shipping to do it with.\n``It [Roosevelt's idea of trusteeship for Indo-China] would only get the British mad. Chiang would go along. Stalin would go along. As for the British, it would only make the British mad. Better to keep quiet, just now.\n``Is that Churchill's idea on all territory out there, that he wants it back just the way they were?'' Roosevelt was asked. He replied, ``Yes, he is mid-Victorian on all things like that.''\n\u201cA reporter asked FDR whether Churchill's position weren't ``inconsistent with a policy of self-determination [as expressed in the Atlantic Charter, for example]?''\n``Yes, that is true,'' Roosevelt replied. The reporter informed the President that Churchill had just the other day reiterated that the principles in the Atlantic Charter, including the clause that gave all peoples held against their will a fundamental right to freedom, was ``not a rule, just a guide.''\n``Do you remember that speech the prime minister made about the fact that he was not made prime minister of Great Britain to see the empire fall apart?'' a reporter asked the President.\n``Dear old Winston will never learn on that point,'' said Roosevelt. ``He has made his specialty on that point. This, of course, is off the record.''\n\u201cIn his last days, Roosevelt was working on plan, which he had preliminarily dubbed ``Food for Peace,'' which involved the unleashing of American agriculture to feed the world, while deploying American technology to make the hungry nations food self-sufficient. He was also preoccupied with trying to prevent the British, in particular Churchill, from staging provocations that would split the United States from Russia, using territorial disputes in Europe as a pretext; at a cabinet meeting on March 16, one of the last attended by FDR, according to the notes of one participant:\n``The President indicated considerable difficulty with British relations.... He stated that the British were perfectly willing for the United States to have a war with Russia at any time and that, in his opinion, to follow the British program would be to proceed toward that end.''\nConclusion\n\u201cOn April 12, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 32nd President of the United States, patriot, and enemy of the British Empire, died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Warm Springs, Georgia. Almost immediately, British agents moved to obliterate Roosevelt's policies and his postwar plans. \u201c\n\u201cOrders that were being prepared for U.S. ships and marines to take Hong Kong and turn it over to the Chinese, were aborted. Other plans to prevent the French from retaking Indochina were cancelled, and American troops in the area were told to stand aside. The imperial flags went back up, as Churchill had been demanding, all over the world. \u201c\n\u201cLater that same month, in San Francisco, the American delegation to the United Nations conference voted against proposals that were aimed at placing the British and French colonial possessions under international supervision and with a definite timetable for independence. America, said delegation leader Harold Stassen, had but one true ally, the British, and we must always stand by her side. The United Nations, taken over by a pack of British agents, including Julian Huxley, soon became a tool for British imperial interests. \u201c\n\u201cIn August, President Truman, manipulated by the British agent Henry Simpson, dropped atomic bombs that Roosevelt never planned to use on a nation already prepared to surrender, claiming to ``save'' American lives in an invasion of Japan--which FDR and his top military commanders knew was unncessary. \u201c\n\u201cNot one of the economic development projects proposed by Roosevelt and already in planning stages, ever saw the light of day. \u201c\n\u201cRoosevelt had failed to develop a leadership cadre to carry on without him. This was, in part, because of his own leadership style, which tended to centralize important decision-making in himself and which often manipulated even his closest aides against each other. Ultimately, he found that aides, like Hurley, were unable to generate ideas or policy. He groomed no political successor, and within the patriotic faction which had, sometimes reluctantly, been forced to follow his leadership, there was no one who could hold a candle to FDR. \u201c\n\u201cBut, Roosevelt was also unable, because of his own limited comprehension of the history of the ideas that informed his thinking, to explain them in their most profound sense to others. He was a patriot, with great instincts, and human compassion, but he had an imperfect understanding of the history of the conflict that he found himself in the middle of: The battle between the American republican tradition and British oligarchism. Those closest to him, often themselves infected with the disease of anglophilia, failed to understand this fight; and without him present, they were easy pickings for skilled British operatives. \u201c\nFDR was arguably the greatest American President of this century, who understood how to use the power of the presidency as no individual before or since. He was, as President, the best at organizing the American citizenry behind a program. Yet, though at war with the British Empire and all it stood for, Roosevelt never brought the American people fully into that battle, never told them of the depths of his disagreements with Churchill. He said he was waiting to do this until the war's end, but it never happened. In the absence of a population mobilized against the British, the invidious Harry Truman, handled for the British by Simpson and Jimmy Byrnes, could reverse the direction of Roosevelt's policies. We thus continue suffer the consequences from this fatal error of Roosevelt's judgment.\u201c\nAttribution:\nThe Other War: FDR's Battle Against Churchill and the British Empire", "The best-known British tribute to FDR is a statue in Grosvenor Square, London.", "When he was in power, during very dark times, I would think the average Brit soaked up the hype and worshipped the man.\nBUT, with hindsight, while strongly supporting Britain after the late, and forced, entry of USA into the war, he did his duty and as far as he could managed affairs to maximise profit for USA.

The problem is that he didn\u2019t propose it as a scientific theory but began proclaiming it as truth, though there was no conclusive proof of it at the time. Even so, Galileo would not have been in so much trouble if he had chosen to stay within the realm of science and out of the realm of theology.\nHe argued that some passages were to be taken literally and others weren\u2019t - which, considering he was not a scriptural scholar, was considered as stepping out of his bounds of knowledge.\nThe net result wasn\u2019t torture and / or death - neither happened. His works were condemned for speculation on (theology) that he didn\u2019t have the knowledge or proof for", "Isaiah 40:22 says the Earth is round, sure, but round is not a sphere. But by the Middle Ages all those educated in a probably fairly recondite area of knowledge understood that that was how it was.\nMost people (if they thought much about it) understood that God made the world and that anything not obvious was explained by the Bible. The Bible agreed (maybe not quite explicitly) with the obvious, that the Earth was at the very centre of Creation and that everything, Sun, Moon and stars went round it. The God created Copernicus who demonstrated mathematically that this view was incorrect and that the Earth\u2019s movement had a centre, the Sun (heliocentricity).\nNot too many people find maths straightforward, so God created Galileo Galilei to make an improved telescope by which maths could be escaped and heliocentricity could be observed (well, more or less). So now it is clear to those who have the chance of doing so can see. So what was actually a bit of a theological sideline was actually wrong, which confronted the educated with an embarrassment and some confusion. Actually many senior clerics did actually see by means of Galileo\u2019s telescope, and they were clever, educated and for the day scientifically informed, including most of the Jesuit order, and Cardinal Bellarmine who had himself supported Galileo and had used his telescope.\nUnfortunately Galileo was not the nicest man and enjoyed taking the piss out of the less well informed and found opportunities to do so in the Bible and its beliefs, and with those he made himself very unpopular, especially in one of his writings in which the victim was the Pope. Now even the clever, educated clerics could not support him. Galileo had even made enemies of them.\nAll this took place while the Roman Catholic Church was dealing with a confrontation with a very major revision of conventions that had held for a millennium. Astronomical revisions that served to enlarge doubts that seemed impossible were not welcome, and intellectual balance was not readily at hand. There were plenty of victims, some of them on the strength of their own delusions (Savonalola, Giordiano Bruno). At least Galileo was permitted to quietly retire, so long as he kept his mouth shut.", "They lied to protect the world from greed most likely", "This is a case of urban myths of history and the Middle Ages is the worst era hit by these misconceptions and outright balderdash.\nFlat Earth is one of them.

Ptolemy - remember him, the guy who supposedly put astronomy in a strait-jacket? - explicitly said in his Almagest that the earth was a sphere. So if the guy who ruled medieval astronomy said the Earth was a sphere, where does the nonsense come from that the Church opposed the idea that the Earth is a sphere? Also, Dante depicted a spherical earth.\nThe Church may have come down on some people who mentioned a spherical earth, but it would have been for other things they wrote.", "Citation needed. To the best of my knowledge, the Catholic Church never denied that the Earth was round. That had been figured out well back into classical antiquity and remained the intellectual consensus thereafter.\nWhat they didn\u2019t agree with was the heliocentric model. The church bought into the intellectual consensus at the time that the spherical Earth was surrounded by systems of epicycles, invisibly transparent crystalline spheres which carried the stars and planets. It took further shifts in scientific thinking after Galileo to change their minds on that point.", "Right from the beginning, the Catholic Church always went with what we would now call the scientific consensus. At that time, there were pretty big holes in both Copernicus\u2019 and Galileo\u2019s theories and the Church was not going to throw its weight behind Galileo, even though he and the pope were friends.

If so, what effect would this have had on the war if they did?\nNO, the Japanese could not have used the Kido Butai to attack both the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor. The first impassable obstacle was logistics: it takes fuel to sail from northern Japan, raid an enemy facility, and return home safely. The Japanese did not have the fuel capacity, or sufficient at-sea refueling capacity, to get from Japan to Panama. The second is that they could not have carried out both such raids in secret. Suppose they had somehow devised a way to go all the way to Panama first, and got there without having been discovered first. An attack on the Canal would start the war and alert all of the forces at Pearl Harbor that the Japanese had a large fleet at sea somewhere east of Hawaii that had to get home to Japan. An intense search effort would follow, plus the forces at PH would be on high alert. The success the Japanese achieved at PH was due, in largest part, to having achieved surprise, without that they would have lost a lot of planes and done much less damage, and if the US carrier forces had located them in range of Hawaii they would likely have sunk some of the Japanese carriers. If they tried it the other way, Hawaii first and then on to the Canal, they would have the same problem\u2026lack of surprise at the target, plus intense searches likely to discover them at sea and sink some of the carriers even before they came within range of the Canal. Then they would still have to try to get back to Japan, which would be a long voyage through hostile seas subject to attack by USN submarines, long-range bombers, and USN carrier forces.\nA third problem is that the carriers could only carry a certain quantity of bombs and ammunition for plane guns. They expended a good deal of this in the raid on PH; they would not have enough to do much damage at the Canal, assuming they went there second and had a (magic) way to get there to launch an attack. This problem would be the same if they attacked the Canal first and then tried to attack PH on the way home.\nFinally, the surprise the Japanese achieved in their PH raid was due, in part, to American complacency about Japanese capabilities and intentions in a time of peace. It was also due to their course to PH\u2026they left far northern Japan and traveled through the stormy winter North Pacific, far off normal trade routes, and so avoided detection by any merchant vessels or USN patrols. There is no such route to Panama from Japan, the Canal was then and is now a major hub for shipping coming out of, or headed into, the Atlantic from the Pacific.

In 1933, Planck, as president of the\nKaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft\n(Kaiser Wilhelm Society), met with Adolf Hitler. During the meeting, Planck told Hitler that forcing Jewish scientists to emigrate would mutilate Germany and the benefits of their work would go to foreign countries. Hitler responded with a rant against Jews and Planck could only remain silent and then take his leave. The National Socialist regime would only come around to the same conclusion as Planck in the 6 July 1942 meeting regarding the future agenda of the\nReichsforschungsrat\n(RFR, Reich Research Council), but by then it was too late.\n\u201cA meeting was held on 6 July 1942 to discuss the function of the RFR and set its agenda. The meeting was a turning point in National Socialism's attitude towards science, as well as recognition that the policies which drove Jewish scientists out of Germany were a mistake, as the Reich needed their expertise.\u201d\nHeisenberg\nsaid in 1939 that the physicists at the (second) meeting said that in principle atomic bombs could be made.... it would take years.... not before five. He said I didn't report it to the Fuehrer until two weeks later and very casually because I did not want the Fuehrer to get so interested that he would order great efforts immediately to make the atomic bomb. Speer felt it was better that the whole thing should be dropped and the Fuehrer also reacted that way. He said they presented the matter in this way for their personal safety as the probability (of success) was nearly zero, but if many thousands (of) people developed nothing, that could have extremely disagreeable consequences for us.\n[17]\nSo we turned the slogan around to make use of warfare for physics not make use of physics for warfare\n[18]\nErhard Milch asked how long America would take and was told 1944 though the group between ourselves thought it would take longer, three or four years.\n[19]\nOn 4 June 1942, a conference regarding the project, initiated by Albert Speer\nas head of the \"Reich Ministry for Armament and Ammunition\" (RMBM: Reichsministerium f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition; after late 1943 the Reich Ministry for Armament and War Production), decided on its continuation merely for the aim of energy production.\n[26]\nOn 9 June 1942, Adolf Hitler\nissued a decree for the reorganization of the RFR as a separate legal entity under the RMBM; the decree appointed Reich Marshal Hermann G\u00f6ring\nas its president.\n[27]\nThe reorganization was done under the initiative of Minister Albert Speer\nof the RMBM; it was necessary as the RFR under Bernhard Rust\nthe Minister of Science, Education and National Culture was ineffective and was not achieving its purpose.\n[28]\nThe hope was that G\u00f6ring would manage the RFR with the same discipline and efficiency as he had the aviation sector. A meeting was held on 6 July 1942 to discuss the function of the RFR and set its agenda. The meeting was a turning point in National Socialism's attitude towards science, as well as recognition that the policies which drove Jewish scientists out of Germany were a mistake, as the Reich needed their expertise. Abraham Esau\nwas appointed on 8 December 1942 as Hermann G\u00f6ring's\nBevollm\u00e4chtigter (plenipotentiary) for nuclear physics research under the RFR; in December 1943, Esau was replaced by Walther Gerlach\n. In the final analysis, placing the RFR under G\u00f6ring's administrative control had little effect on the German nuclear weapon project.\nSpeer states that the project to develop the atom bomb was scuttled in the autumn of 1942. Though the scientific solution was there, it would have taken all of Germany's production resources to produce a bomb, and then no sooner than 1947.\n[33]\nDevelopment did continue with a \"uranium motor\" for the navy and development of a German cyclotron\n. However, by the summer of 1943, Speer released the remaining 1200 metric tons\nof uranium stock for the production of solid-core ammunition.\n[34]\nThe most influential people in the Uranverein were Kurt Diebner\n, Abraham Esau\n, Walther Gerlach\n, and Erich Schumann\n; Schumann was one of the most powerful and influential physicists in Germany. Diebner, throughout the life of the nuclear weapon project, had more control over nuclear fission research than did Walther Bothe\n, Klaus Clusius\n, Otto Hahn\n, Paul Harteck\n, or Werner Heisenberg\n. Abraham Esau was appointed as Hermann G\u00f6ring's plenipotentiary for nuclear physics research in December 1942; Walther Gerlach succeeded him in December 1943.\nPoliticization of the German academia\nunder the National Socialist\nregime had driven many physicists, engineers, and mathematicians out of Germany as early as 1933. Those of Jewish heritage who did not leave were quickly purged from German institutions, further thinning the ranks of academia. The politicization of the universities, along with the demands for manpower by the German armed forces (many scientists and technical personnel were conscripted, despite possessing useful skills), substantially reduced the number of able German physicists.\n[2]\nEmigrations[edit]\nAdolf Hitler took power on 30 January 1933. On 7 April, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was enacted; this law, and its subsequent related ordinances, politicized the education system in Germany. This had immediate damaging effects on the physics capabilities of Germany. Furthermore, combined with the\nDeutsche Physik\nmovement, the damaging effects were intensified and prolonged. The consequences to physics in Germany and its subfield of nuclear physics were multifaceted.\nAn immediate consequence upon passage of the law was that it produced both quantitative and qualitative losses to the physics community. Numerically, it has been estimated that a total of 1,145 university teachers, in all fields, were driven from their posts, which represented about 14% of the higher learning institutional staff members in 1932\u20131933.\n[45]\nOut of 26 German nuclear physicists cited in the literature before 1933, 50% emigrated.\n[46]\nQualitatively, 11 physicists and four chemists who had won or would win the Nobel Prize emigrated from Germany shortly after Hitler came to power, most of them in 1933.\n[47]\nThese 15 scientists were: Hans Bethe, Felix Bloch, Max Born, Albert Einstein, James Franck, Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn, Peter Debye, Dennis Gabor, Fritz Haber, Gerhard Herzberg, Victor Hess, George de Hevesy, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Otto Stern, and Eugene Wigner. Britain and the United States were often the recipients of the talent which left Germany.\n[48]\nThe University of G\u00f6ttingen had 45 dismissals from the staff of 1932\u20131933, for a loss of 19%.\n[45]\nEight students, assistants, and colleagues of the G\u00f6ttingen theoretical physicist Max Born left Europe after Hitler came to power and eventually found work on the Manhattan Project, thus helping the United States, Britain and Canada to develop the atomic bomb; they were Enrico Fermi,\n[49]\nJames Franck, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Robert Oppenheimer (who was American, but had studied under Born), Edward Teller, Victor Weisskopf, Eugene Wigner, and John von Neumann.\n[50]\nOtto Robert Frisch, who with Rudolf Peierls first calculated the critical mass of U-235 needed for an explosive, was also a Jewish refugee.\nMax Planck, the father of quantum theory, had been right in assessing the consequences of National Socialist policies. In 1933, Planck, as president of the\nKaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft\n(Kaiser Wilhelm Society), met with Adolf Hitler. During the meeting, Planck told Hitler that forcing Jewish scientists to emigrate would mutilate Germany and the benefits of their work would go to foreign countries. Hitler responded with a rant against Jews and Planck could only remain silent and then take his leave. The National Socialist regime would only come around to the same conclusion as Planck in the 6 July 1942 meeting regarding the future agenda of the\nReichsforschungsrat\n(RFR, Reich Research Council), but by then it was too late.\n[29]\n[51]\nAt the end of the war, the Allied powers competed to obtain surviving components of the nuclear industry (personnel, facilities, and materiel\n), as they did with the pioneering V-2\nSRBM\nprogram\nGerman historian Klaus Hentschel summarizes the organizational differences as:\nCompared with the British and American war research efforts united in the Manhattan Project, to this day the prime example of 'big science,\" the Uranverein was only a loosely knit, decentralized network of researchers with quite different research agendas. Rather than teamwork as on the American end, on the German side we find cut-throat competition, personal rivalries, and fighting over the limited resources.\n[119]\nIn terms of financial and human resources, the comparisons between the Manhattan Project and the Uranverein are stark. The Manhattan Project consumed some US$2 billion (1945) in government funds, and employed at its peak some 120,000 people, mostly in the sectors of construction and operations. Total, the Manhattan Project involved the labor of some 500,000 people, nearly 1% of the entire US civilian labor force.\n[120]\nBy comparison, the Uranverein was budgeted a mere 8 million reichsmarks, equivalent to about US$2 million (1945) \u2014 a factor of 1,000 less.\n[121]\nNear the end of World War II, the principal Allied war powers each made plans for exploitation of German science. In light of the implications of nuclear weapons, German nuclear fission and related technologies were singled out for special attention. In addition to exploitation, denial of these technologies, their personnel, and related materials to rival allies was a driving force of their efforts. This typically meant getting to these resources first, which to some extent put the Soviets at a disadvantage in some geographic locations easily reached by the Western Allies, even if the area was destined to be in the Soviet zone of occupation by the Potsdam Conference\n. At times all parties were heavy-handed in their pursuit and denial to others.\nThe best known US denial and exploitation effort was Operation Paperclip\n, a broad dragnet that encompassed a wide range of advanced fields, including jet and rocket propulsion, nuclear physics, and other developments with military applications such as infrared technology. Operations directed specifically towards German nuclear fission were Operation Alsos\nand Operation Epsilon\n, the latter being done in collaboration with the British. In lieu of the codename for the Soviet operation it is referred to by Oleynikov as the Russian \"Alsos\"\n.\n[78]", "Basically Germany was way way off a deliverable nuclear weapon.\nAnd the reasons for this are:\nIt was Jewish science and thus discounted by the Nazis.\nA large number of Jewish physicists had left including Einstein although Heisenberg stayed and then he had some explaining to do after the war.\nThe sheer industrial scale of it all and the cost of it. The US Manhattan project to develop the atomic bomb cost by all accounts over 20 billion dollars in todays currency in addition to the brilliant physicists that such a project needs. It was a truly huge project.\nBasically, Germany did not have the will or the assets to create a nuclear weapon and also post war research showed their research path was on the wrong track anyway.", "As others have already written, not very close at all. Due to the Nazis banning the use of any work or theory\u2019s put forward by Jewish scientists and engineers they were having to reinvent the wheel so to speak.\nThe Manhattan Project received $2Billion in finance and 5% of the US wartime workforce the German project got $2Million and approximately 1,000 people.\nGerman nuclear weapons program - Wikipedia", "Hitler was not real close, because developing a nuclear weapon was not his priority.

conviction regardless of whether any real evidence will ever be forthcoming.\nthat is why we have faith.\nfaith expresses our conviction in something intangible within ourselves that cannot be denied in spite of any lack of evidence.\nwhen we feel our own spirit it feels like something dwelling within us in our heart. when we recognize this indwelling spirit in other people we learn to extend our faith in our own spirit to other living beings.\nspiritual experiences often leave people with a strong conviction that everyone or everything in the worlds and universes they experience shares this indwelling spirit, and as language and cultures evolved their concepts regarding this indwelling spirit evolved into nature spirits, deities, pantheons, and religions.\nwe all share the same indwelling spirit which may be regarded as distinct from one\u2019s own spirit on one hand, but also as providing us with identity with some global or universal spirit on another hand.\nfortunately, we have more than two hands, eh? <wink>\nanyways\u2026\nthat\u2019s a sufficient story for spirit in the first case, and we are pretty sure you are clever enough to apply what we have shared with you to the remaining cases on your own.\n\u2026\n-enjoy!\nlove, the grigs\u2026\n\u2026\nif you liked this answer you may also like to read any of the following:\ngharveyn's article: hell in a

All these issues were addressed in early legislation.\nThe kinds of things that one might think of such as prayer to Mary, reception of sacraments, and the uses of sacred vestments were not initially the issue.\nKeeping in mind that the King\u2019s health was in decline, what followed the Act of Supremacy and related legislation, was basically a struggle between three groups. The King was conservative and preferred to keep rituals and sacraments as they had always been. But he had appointed Cromwell and Cranmer to high posts to facilitate his annulment. They were part of the second group of reformers who had been influenced by Luther and other Continental reformers. (Incidentally, Cromwell was beheaded by the King. Folks took these disagreements seriously in those days).\nThe third, least powerful group were the Anabaptists who had been influenced by radical reforms on the Continent.\nSo if we were to ask what was the difference between the national Church in England and the Catholic Church, we would have to define exactly when and where. The Monasteries were suppressed starting in 1536. Mass was said in English. Pilgrimages and lesser feast days were abolished. Generally the veneration of relics and that sort of thing were done away with.\nAnabaptists were persecuted. But conservatives (catholics) and reformers (Lutherans) continued to push and pull back and forth. It was not until Edward\u2019s reign that the Protestant forces clearly gained the upper hand.", "There was no Anglican Church until Henry Vlll created it and abandoned the Catholic Church (parted company with ROME).", "The major difference was that the Pope was the head of the Catholic Church and Henry VIII was the head of the Anglican Church. England no longer had to pay monies to Rome and the monasteries, convents and abbeys that had been owned by the Church were now controlled by Henry, through his officials. Selling these brought Henry enormous wealth. At the time, doctrinally, there was little difference and Henry considered himself to be a Catholic. The Ten Articles of 1536, probably writter by Archbishop Cranmer, explained the new doctrines:\nArticles related to doctrines:\n1. That Holy Scriptures and the three Creeds are the basis and summary of a true Christian faith.\n2. That baptism conveys remission of sins and the regenerating grace of the Holy Spirit, and is absolutely necessary as well for children as adults.\n3. That penance consists of contrition, confession, and reformation, and is necessary to salvation.\n4. That the body and blood of Christ are really present in the elements of the eucharist.\n5. That justification is remission of sin and reconciliation to God by the merits of Christ; but good works are necessary.\nArticles related to ceremonies:\n1. That images are useful as remembrancers, but are not objects of worship.\n2. That saints are to be honored as examples of life, and as furthering our prayers.\n3. That saints may be invoked as intercessors, and their holydays observed.\n4. That ceremonies are to be observed for the sake of their mystical signification, and as conducive to devotion.\n5. That prayers for the dead are good and useful, but the efficacy of papal pardon, and of soul-masses offered at certain localities, is negatived."], "topic_list": ["Church of England", "Anglicanism", "King Henry VIII (historical figure)", "Catholic Churches", "History of Great Britain", "Churches", "Catholicism", "Christianity", "Religion", "History"], "view_list": [100, 4, 44], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Blake Winfield", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "question_title": "What was the major difference between the Anglican Church and the Catholic Church during the reign of Henry the VIII?", "respond_collected": 3, "no_of_view": "1,302", "name_list": ["Mark Kuga-Henderson", "Brian Davis", "Anonymous"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020"]}, "839": {"ans_list": ["Constitutional monarchy"], "topic_list": ["The 18th Century", "England", "Government", "History"], "view_list": [5], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Efrayim Bulka", "upvote_list": [0], "question_title": "What type of government did England have in the 18th century?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "329", "name_list": ["Joe Daws"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020"]}, "820": {"ans_list": ["Very few rich people had money.

The Tests showed ZERO gun powder reside even in a minut amount! 2. 2 other two Texas school depository employees testified under Oath, the Oswald was with them in the break room eating lunch, and his time card confirmed that he indeed had been off the clock and in the lunch room, and another employee had left the break room and went to do some cleaning upstairs. When they were questioned about this stranger, no one had seen him before that day and he said his name was ( Frank), and he was ( New). Their testimony was in the Dallas Police report, but left out of the Warren Commission report!! In CIA files it is confirmed that a CIA operative names Frank Sturgis was in Dallas that whole week, but vanished the day JFK was murdered. E. Howard Hunt. Was there also and in a CIA declassified report, these two men Traveled together to Dallas with another unnamed Hispanic man. George Bush Sr. Was also in Dallas the night before at a Big Oilman named Clint Murcheson along with VP LBJ. Bush senior and LBJ and a group of about 10 other men met privately the night before at Murcheson home in which One man overheard LBJ boast,( After tomorrow) we won\u2019t have to worry about that SOB Jack Kennedy! LBJ, the FBI, the CIA and Cuban operatives and mob operatives were involved. I have seen ( secret files that are deep, deep inside ( Secret archives)!Oswald had a double in Dallas that day planted by CIA. Our FBI and CIA are corrupt EVEN today! That\u2019s why I left and went as intelligence consult. Christoper Wray is maybe as Corrupt as james Comey!! If you trust the CIA or FBI , all I can say is ( Wolves Eat Sheep)", "I don't know? I have a better question; how would someone defend the propanda that Lee Harvey Oswald did assassinate JFK, while condemning those, who have the common sense to question and even suggest a conspiracy murdered Kennedy?", "READ MY MOUSE >> Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK in the head with a 6.5 MM bullet .Then JFK ceased to function ,He is no longer vertical.Worry about Jeff Epstein . Where is he? Is he really dead?", "I would defend the fact (not speculation) that Oswald alone shot JFK by citing the evidence. Vincent Bugliosi, who successfully prosecuted Manson, conducted a mock trial of Oswald, using only admissible evidence subject to the same rules that would have applied to a real trial, using a retired judge, Dallas-area people as a jury, and Jerry Spence, the cowboy hat guy who has never lost a murder case defending Oswald.\nOswald was convicted. Read the Warren Report. It's not some black magic bible that will summon demons, it's an exhaustive discussion of named eyewitnesses, medical findings, and ballistic information. Conspiracy fans will screech and call it a \u201cwhitewash\u201d, but I've only met one person who believed it was a conspiracy who had bothered to read it.\nBugliosi said there was more evidence pointing directly at Oswald than he had ever seen in any other case, and no evidence pointing at anyone else.\nI am an attorney. I deal in evidence. I know what is and is not evidence, and need to know what is convincing and what is weak. I do it for a living. There is a ton of evidence Oswald did it: he tried to kill General Walker in March 1963 with the same rifle, he took the rifle to work that day, he was seen in the window, he fled and murdered officer Tippett in front of 12 eyewitnesses, on and on. He did it. There is no mystery.", "The Altgens # 6 photo shows a shattered windshield at the same time JFK is clutching his throat doesn\u2019t jive with a lone assassin, as the Magic bullet wounded both men and was recovered after it fell out of Connolly\u2019s leg at the hospital.\nLet\u2019s review that mystical magic bullet theory. We know that a bullet entered JFK\u2019s throat. The Parkland Doctors who had seen many bullet wounds called this an entry wound. The non medical Warren Commission called this an exit wound, where the bullet continued onward to cause massive wounds in the Texas Governor.\nRegardless of entry or exit, Kennedy\u2019s hands didn\u2019t rise up to his throat until after he had been shot. The Governor shows no such signs of being wounded until much later. While JFK will slowly start to lean forward and begin dropping his arms away from his throat, just before a fatal head shot, Connolly can be seen turning to his right almost completely backwards, facing JFK, looking for where the shot had come from. This is also three seconds since Kennedy reached for his throat.\nAs Connolly begins turning forward he seems to be hit just mere fractions of a second before JFK\u2019s fatal head shot. Both men seem to collapse to their seats at the same time. All one has to do is watch the Zapruder film and this is plain as day. There isn\u2019t any connection between the throat wound and Connolly being injured. NONE!\nBut the politically hastened Warren Commission said their was and the Zapruder film was withheld from the public for 12 years so the Magic Bullet theory could go unchallenged. It is amazing how anyone can tell people with a straight face that the \u201cMagic\u201d bullet wounded two men.\nBefore the injury to James Tague was taken into consideration, both the Secret Service and the FBI assumed the firing sequence had been, JFK, then Connolly, then fatal head shot, JFK. And this sequence determined after reviewing the Zapruder film.\nSo a person has to man up and declare the Magic Bullet Theory is pure garbage. Garbage in equals garbage out. So if the Magic Bullet Theory doesn\u2019t hold up, there was a conspiracy. And if there was a conspiracy, there isn\u2019t any proof that Oswald fired the fatal head shot.\nNow that a conspiracy has been established, which wasn\u2019t hard to do, just reviewing Altgens #6 photo and the Zapruder film, one has to wonder why the FBI would so obviously mislead the American public to pin the blame totally on Oswald, while not pursuing the other assassin(s). This points to FBI Director Hoover purposely misdirecting the investigation. But this gets beyond the simple point that the known assassin was likely shooting from the grassy knoll, where Oswald wasn\u2019t.", "You'd have to say the investigation purposely framed him as it was his gun with his fingerprints on and then you'd probably say the witnesses who identified him as having shot Tipett were mistaken or lying.

These perpetual victims are mired in a perverse culture of lies and self deceit.\nInvestigation Exposes Israel\u2019s Secretive Assassination Program\nIt was double poisoning \u2014 it was done in France. The radioactive poison introduced in his body while in ICU dept. Was Pb212 Was part of preclinical study done by Areva. Radiation poisoning and radioactive poisoning are different. Arafat (Louvet, Martipon) was indeed murdered by poisoning. In fact it was double poisoning: alpha and gamma. In other words was radioactive poisoning and radiation poisoning. It didn\u2019t take place in Rammalah \u2014 it was done in Paris, at the Percy Mil. Hospital in Clamart.\nAnd yes, we can talk about polonium, but not 210Po \u2014 it was a different isotope. And was not introduced in the body \u2014 it was produced inside the body (in vivo), by a different substance. All this can be seen in the medical report, more precisely in the radio-toxicology lab. report. The problem with their report (of the radio-tox lab) is the fact that one thing is in the test results of the urine (the gamma detection \u2014 where the source of radioactivity in the body is detected, and can be seen the polonium isotope) and totally oposite is written in the interpretation (the report of the lab , pretending that they didn\u2019t find anything).\nAnd everybody is relaying on the report not the data from the test. By my calculation, correlated with the rest of the medical file, the radioactive substance (also identified in the test) was introduced in his body on 7-8 November, when he was in ICU.\nThe radiation poisoning (gamma, X-ray) was done on 2 stages: first on arrival at hospital (29.11) through two full body scans at huge doses (the second scan, with contrast, was not necessary). Second, early on 3.11 , when other 2 scans (CT) were done on chest and abdomen-pelvis (not mentioned in the medical file) PLUS 4 scans done on the head (2,5 and 5 mm , both without and with contrast). Altogether is a huge dose of gamma (ionizing radiation, X-ray) \u2014 most of the scans totally unjustified from medical , scientifical, diagnostic point of view. The first 2 scans (huge dose full body CT) decreased the immune system at a very low level, the next 2 (not mentioned in the medical file ) decreased further the immune system and the following $ scans (CT) at the head made sure that the hemorrhage will occur there . It is not surprising that the stroke-hemmorhagy was at the brain level.\nThe case has nothing to do with politics \u2014 it has to do only with corporate greed. The radioactive substance introduced in the body (caught at gamma detector in the radio-tox lab) was contemplated at that time to be used in the future in Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (radioimmunotherapy) and data had to be collected prior to clinical trials, to convince potential investors , and studies re. stability , etc. had to be done under table\u2014it is difficult to explain to someone out of the field. The only location on earth where that radioactive substance is produced is next door to the hospital , at Bessines-sur-Gartempe , in the Limousin area. Produced , of course, pharmaceutical grade \u2014 and with a very short half-life time.\nHence why Israeli intelligence officials desperately tried to prevent Ronen Bergman from writing \u201cRise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel\u2019s Targeted Assassinations,\u201d a stunning book exposing the details of Israel\u2019s extrajudicial killing program.\nIt kind of sounds like, as someone who was raised within the indoctrinative environment of Israel, he may have bought their justifications a but too much (perhaps he is just giving their reasoning, but he doesn\u2019t say anything really to indicate that it was problematic). The idea that they were assassinating these people in order to \u201cprevent the next war\u201d would ring a lot truer is the same Israeli military-intelligence machine wasn\u2019t engaged in wars of aggression throughout this whole time period. I am sure that the propaganda justification provided to the Israeli public is that all of this is just absolute necessary to defend the Jewish people from absolute existential threats, and that many believe it, just as people believe the claim that Saddam Hussein or the Taliban or Assad or Gaddafi were Hitlerian threats to America and the world which justified war after war and hundreds of thousands of casualties. But the fact is, the people actually starting the (avoidable, aggressive) wars were hawks in Likud and other right-wing parties, and internally among themselves they are very explicitly clear. These wars are intended to imperially expand Israel\u2019s borders \u2014 not to protect them \u2014 they intend to create a \u201cGreater Israel\u201d by taking more and more land from Palestinians, Syrians, Egyptians, Lebanese \u2014 but obviously most centrally and consistently the Palestinians, who they have virtually genocided, gradually displacing more and more while holding them in an open-air prison... Thanks to an ideological starting point of ethnic nationalism, they have created a paranoid fear of external enemies (just like all kinds of fascists have historically) and taken this \u201crise up and kill them first\u201d mentality to an extreme conclusion where the use of apartheid policy within Israel and borderline-genocidal mass murder outside, in newly occupied territories, is more resemblant of the workings of the Nazi state than it is preventative of that kind of ethnic fascism. They claim to be a liberal democracy, but democracy is barely compatible with liberal economics, and certainly not with authoritarian ethnic nationalism of the kind the ruling parties in Israel support. You can\u2019t have a democracy and still exclude Arabs, who aren\u2019t even allowed to use the same roads... And you can\u2019t be an aggressive imperial power (whether you\u2019re Israel, Saudi Arabia, or the US) and still claim to just be defending yourself.\nAmy Goodman and Juan Gonz\u00e1lez gave this liberal apologist for colonial violence free running on a clear track, and he produced some quality hasbara. The narcissism of the man\u2019s position, along with the false narrative that Israel is in mortal danger always and everywhere, combined to lay bare the soul of the Zionist project. In every instance, he spoke of the murders carried out by Israel as occurring in a context of absolute peril directed at the forces of the fledgling state (a liberal democracy, he reminded us) and its Jewish population. The reality he\u2019s trying to disguise is that Israel bombs, shoots, burns, tortures and maims dispossessed Palestinians living in a welter of intolerable conditions \u2014 military despotism, forced poverty, and a complete absence of civil and political rights, under a separate regime the world knows by the name \u201capartheid\u201d. You\u2019d never realise any of this if you only went by Bergman\u2019s presentation. Frankly, I was surprised at how little opposition (practically none) he encountered in his depiction of Israel not as a brutal settler colonial power wielding overwhelming and illegitimate force against a captive indigenous population, but a benign refuge for persecuted people. In fact, he repeatedly made the point that the tragedy of this conflict lies in the loss of innocence experienced by Israel as its ranks of war criminal-heroes are forced to do terrible things for the holiest of purposes. All in all, we were treated to a full exposition of the justified lawlessness at the heart of Zionism.

The Armenian rebels remained in control of Van until the arrival of a Russian armed force from Persia in May. In June the Russian armed force retreated back over the border into Persia, and the Armenian population went with them. It was the Armenian uprising in Van and the accompanying massacres of the Muslim, mainly Kurdish population, that caused the Ottoman Government to decide on the deportation of the Armenian population of most of Anatolia to northern Syria.\nMost of the massacres of Muslims perpetrated by Armenians occurred after much of eastern Anatolia was occupied by the Russian Army early in 1916. The Russians were assisted by Armenian auxiliaries, who wanted to create an Armenian state in the region, and for that purpose began to try to ethnically cleanse the region of its majority Muslim population, by massacre or expulsion.

Their Armenian auxiliaries tried to hang on to the region, but themselves were forced to retreat by the advancing Ottoman forces. As the Armenian bands retreated back to the Russian border, they carried out vast massacres of the Muslim population of every town they passed through, for example in Erzurum. The advancing Ottoman forces found large numbers of bodies of massacred civilians in every town they came to.\nAfter the Ottoman Empire surrendered in October 1918, Allied military officers were able to enter eastern Anatolia in order to observe the operation of the armistice conditions.

Yet despite this, the Italian language as we know it today is the result of a long process of evolution and debates, which began in the 1600s, over what the correct form of the language should be. At the end, the question of what Italian to speak remained. Even though at the end of the 1900s many writers and cultural figures were being inspired by the Tuscan model, in every aspect of the language, there are several relevant historical and social factors that need to be considered.\nFirstly, for centuries up until the Unification of Italy\nin 1861, the country was divided into a number of different states, which were usually under foreign rule. When Italy was united in 1861 the decision was taken to make Tuscan the official language of the country.\nWithin the Italian population, however, there was and always had been high rates of illiteracy, and this illiteracy continued predominantly in rural regions until the 1950s.\nAs a result, dialects were used as the everyday language for centuries, and anyone who was able to express themselves and communicate in Italian did so using grammatical, lexical and phonetical aspects influenced by regional and local dialects.\nUse of dialects in Italy\nThe use of dialects in Italy represents a unique situation compared to the rest of Europe. Even today in many different parts of Italy dialects are used as an informal way of communicating in different social settings and within families.\nContrary to popular belief, in certain Italian regions dialects are widely used\n, and not only within the older generations. Even though the use of standard Italian prevails in the younger generations, many young people can express themselves in their own dialect, or at least understand it, in informal social situations.\nIt is also worth remembering that dialects, as well as accents, can change a lot even within the same region.\nIf you take Tuscany as an example, even though there aren\u2019t real and proper dialects, the Florentine accent\ngreatly differs from that of Pisa or Livorno and that of Lucca or Arezzo.\nIn other regions, it is easy to spot dialectal differences between places in the same Province, or every those just a few kilometres away from each other. In other regions, it is easy to spot dialectal differences between places in the same Province, or every those just a few kilometres away from each other.\nDialects and regional Italian\nFor a long time, dialects have been incorrectly considered the \u201cpoor and impoverished parents\u201d of standard Italian, which has mainly developed from the Tuscan dialect. Yet, in reality, dialects represent a cultural richness.\nThis can be seen in the fact that in the last 50 years many regional terms, from Tuscany, Lombardy, Veneto, Naples and Sicily, have entered the national language. As such, it isn\u2019t surprising that dialects have been heavily studied by linguists and have been used in literature and poetry.\nIn the past, there was a prejudice towards dialects, with people thinking that standard Italian was the language used by the bourgeoise, while dialects were used by farmers and the working class, yet now this prejudice has mostly died out. For example, recent statistics have revealed that in Veneto, which is one of the most economically developed regions, around half of the population speak in dialect both with their families and with friends.\nAll you need to do is walk around one of the beautiful and historic cities of Veneto like Venice, Padua, Treviso, Verona or Vicenza to realise just how present dialects are in urban centres.\nThe spreading of standard Italian\nIn 1950, just as the country was going through a time of complete infrastructural, economic, social and politic reconstruction, less than 20% of the Italian population spoke Italian fluently in their day to day to life.\nIlliteracy and semi-illiteracy were largely present in various groups of the population. The Italian Constitution\n, which was established in 1948, gave everyone the right to a basic education.\nYet in certain situations this right to education was not completely guaranteed. Access to higher education and university was pretty much only reserved for children from more affluent families, while children from working class and farming families ended up just being an economic resource for the family.\nThis meant that many children didn\u2019t even finish primary school, even though the law demanded they stay in school until they were 18 or 20, before taking part in compulsory military service.\nPerhaps rather strangely, the event which had the biggest impact in kickstarting the unification of the language was the introduction of television\n.\nTV programs began to be broadcast by RAI\n, the state broadcaster, in 1954 on just one channel. In the years that followed, up until the economic boom between 1958 and 1962, television did not just become a way to bring people together (as very few people actually had a TV set), but also a way to broadcast cultural programs and linguistic models.\nIn fact, between 1960 and 1968 RAI broadcast a show in the late afternoon which was called Non \u00e8 mai troppo tardi\n, or \u201cIt\u2019s never too late,\u201d which was presented by the teacher Alberto Manzi. As a result of this show, many illiterate people learnt to read and write, and it is estimated that in this period around one and a half million Italians managed to get their certificate of primary education.\nAnd so, the spreading of a standardised Italian language was aided by economic growth, a better quality of life, the gradual spread of education and linguistic programmes shown on TV."], "topic_list": ["History of Italy", "Culture of Italy", "Italian Ethnicity and People", "Italian (language)", "Italy", "History"], "view_list": [20], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Naman", "upvote_list": [2], "question_title": "How has the Italian language changed over time?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "176", "name_list": ["Schanna Muliyil"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020"]}, "0": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Roman Empire", "Ancient Rome", "Ancient History", "History"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Ramkumar Parthipan", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "Why was there a shortage of workers in the Roman Empire?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "81", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "628": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["History of Italy", "Byzantines", "Rome, Italy", "Roman Empire", "Ancient Rome", "Italy", "Ancient History", "History"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 4, "question_author": "Dani Grimblat", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "How long did it take to get from Italy to Caesarea during the Roman times?

Czechia represented the most industrialized regions of continental Europe. Therefore, it is not possible to speak only about sugar exports, when there were such large enterprises as Plze\u0148 (Pilsner) \u0160koda (the biggest competitor of the German steel and armor concern Krupp), which successfully competed with it on foreign markets., companies that later formed Prague \u010cKD, North Moravian steelworks and ironworks and the entire structure of coal mines.

Laurin & Klement was exported to neighboring Germany by other industrial companies from Czechia.

Its legal successor is the University of Miskolc\nin Hungary.\nBME University\nis considered\n[by whom?\n]\nthe world's oldest institute of technology which has university rank and structure. It was the first institute in Europe to train engineers at university level.\n[24]\nThe legal predecessor of the university was founded in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II\n, and was named Latin\n: Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum (\"Institute of Geometry and Hydrotechnics\").\nTHE FIRST STEAM ENGINE IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE.\nThe first steam engines\nof continental Europe\nwas built in \u00dajb\u00e1nya \u2013 K\u00f6ngisberg, Kingdom of Hungary (Today Nov\u00e1 Ba\u0148a\nSlovakia) in 1722. They were similar to the Newcomen engines, it served on pumping water from mines.[40]\n[41]\n[42]\n[43]\nAutomotive industry\nPrior to World War I, the Kingdom of Hungary had four car manufacturer companies; Hungarian car production started in 1900. Automotive factories in the Kingdom of Hungary manufactured motorcycles, cars, taxicabs, trucks and buses. These were: the Ganz company\n[63]\n[64]\nin Budapest, R\u00c1BA Automobile\n[65]\nin Gy\u0151r\n, M\u00c1G (later Magomobil\n)[66]\n[67]\nin Budapest, and MARTA (Hungarian Automobile Joint-stock Company Arad\n)[68]\nin Arad\n.\nTurbogenerators\nThe first turbo-generators were water turbines\nwhich propelled electric generators. The first Hungarian water turbine was designed by the engineers of the Ganz Works in 1866, the mass production with dynamo generators started in 1883.\n[95]\nThe manufacturing of steam turbo generators started in the Ganz Works in 1903.\nIn 1905, the L\u00e1ng Machine Factory\ncompany also started the production of steam turbines for alternators.\n[96]\nLight bulbs, radio tubes and X-ray\nTungsram\nis a Hungarian manufacturer of light bulbs and vacuum tubes since 1896. On 13 December 1904, Hungarian S\u00e1ndor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman were granted a Hungarian patent (No. 34541) for the world's first tungsten filament lamp. The tungsten filament lasted longer and gave brighter light than the traditional carbon filament. Tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1904. This type is often called Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries.\n[97]\nTheir experiments also showed that the luminosity of bulbs filled with an inert gas was higher than in vacuum. The tungsten filament outlasted all other types (especially the former carbon filaments). The British Tungsram Radio Works was a subsidiary of the Hungarian Tungsram in pre-WW2 days.\nDespite the long experimentation with vacuum tubes at Tungsram company, the mass production of radio tubes begun during WW1,\n[98]\nand the production of X-ray tubes\nstarted also during the WW1 in Tungsram Company.\n[99]\nHome appliances\nThe Orion Electronics\nwas founded in 1913. Its main profiles were the production of electrical switches, sockets, wires, incandescent lamps, electric fans, electric kettles, and various household electronics.\nPower plants, generators and transformers\nIn 1878, the Ganz company's general manager Andr\u00e1s Mechwart (1853\u20131942) founded the Department of Electrical Engineering headed by K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky\n(1860\u20131939). Engineers Miksa D\u00e9ri\n(1854\u20131938) and Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy\n(1860\u20131939) also worked at the department producing direct-current machines and arc lamps.\nIn autumn 1884, K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky\n, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy\nand Miksa D\u00e9ri\n(ZBD), three engineers associated with the Ganz factory, had determined that open-core devices were impracticable, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage.\n[72]\nIn their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a) wound around iron wire ring core or b) surrounded by iron wire core.\n[73]\nThe two designs were the first application of the two basic transformer constructions in common use to this day, which can as a class all be termed as either core form or shell form (or alternatively, core type or shell type), as in a) or b), respectively (see images).[74\n[75]\n[76]\n[77]\nThe Ganz factory had also in the autumn of 1884 made delivery of the world's first five high-efficiency AC transformers, the first of these units having been shipped on September 16, 1884.[78]\nThis first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40 Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form.[78]\nIn both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see Toroidal cores\nbelow). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs.[79]\nThe Hungarian \"ZBD\" team invented the first high efficiency, closed core shunt connection transformer\nand practical parallel-connected distribution circuits.\nThe ZBD patents included two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning the use of parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1,400 to 2,000 V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100 V initially preferred).[80]\n[81]\nWhen employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces.[82]\n[83]\nBl\u00e1thy had suggested the use of closed cores, Zipernowsky had suggested the use of parallel shunt connections\n, and D\u00e9ri had performed the experiments;[84]\nThe other essential milestone was the introduction of 'voltage source, voltage intensive' (VSVI) systems'[85]\nby the invention of constant voltage generators in 1885.[86]\nOtt\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy also invented the first AC electricity meter\n.[87]\n[88]\n[89]\n[90]\nTransformers today are designed on the principles discovered by the three engineers. They also popularized the word 'transformer' to describe a device for altering the emf of an electric current,[82]\n[91]\n[92]\n[93]\nIn 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the Ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for, the world's first power station\nthat used AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network, the steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.[94]\nThe reliability of the AC technology received impetus after the Ganz Works electrified a large European metropolis: Rome\nin 1886.[94]\nTelecommunication\nThe first telegraph station on Hungarian territory was opened in December 1847 in Pressburg/ Pozsony /Bratislava\n/. In 1848, \u2013 during the Hungarian Revolution \u2013 another telegraph centre was built in Buda\nto connect the most important governmental centres. The first telegraph connection between Vienna and Pest \u2013 Buda (later Budapest) was constructed in 1850.\n[100]\nIn 1884, 2,406 telegraph post offices operated in the Kingdom of Hungary.\n[101]\nBy 1914 the number of telegraph offices reached 3,000 in post offices, and a further 2,400 were installed in the railway stations of the Kingdom of Hungary.\n[102]\nThe first Hungarian telephone exchange\nwas opened in Budapest (May 1, 1881).\n[103]\nAll telephone exchanges of the cities and towns in the Kingdom of Hungary were linked in 1893.[100]\nBy 1914, more than 2,000 settlements had telephone exchange in the Kingdom of Hungary.[102]\nThe Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3\n(Telephone Herald) service was established in 1893. Two decades before the introduction of radio broadcasting, residents of Budapest could listen to news, cabaret, music and opera at home and in public spaces daily. It operated over a special type of telephone exchange system and its own separate network. The technology was later licensed in Italy and the United States. (see: telephone newspaper\n).\nThe first Hungarian telephone factory (Factory for Telephone Apparatuses) was founded by J\u00e1nos Neuhold in Budapest in 1879, which produced telephones microphones, telegraphs, and telephone exchanges.[104]\n[105]\n[106]\nIn 1884, the Tungsram\ncompany also started to produce microphones, telephone apparatuses, telephone switchboards and cables.[107]\nThe Ericsson\ncompany also established a factory for telephones and switchboards in Budapest in 1911.[108]\nRailways and locomotive industry\nThe first Hungarian steam-locomotive railway line was opened on 15 July 1846, between Pest and V\u00e1c.[47]\nBy 1910, the total length of the rail networks of the Hungarian Kingdom had reached 22,869 km (14,210 mi); the Hungarian network linked more than 1,490 settlements. This has ranked Hungarian railways as the sixth-most dense in the world (ahead of countries as Germany or France).\n[48]\nLocomotive engine and railway vehicle manufacturers before World War One\n(engines and wagons, bridge and iron structures) were the M\u00c1VAG\ncompany in Budapest (steam engines and wagons) and the Ganz company\nin Budapest (steam engines, wagons, the production of electric locomotives\nand electric trams started from 1894).[49]\nand the R\u00c1BA Company\nin Gy\u0151r\n.\nThe Ganz Works identified the significance of induction motors and synchronous motors commissioned K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3 (1869\u20131931) to develop it. In 1894, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3\ndeveloped high-voltage three-phase AC motors and generators for electric locomotives. The first-ever electric rail vehicle manufactured by Ganz Works was a 6 HP pit locomotive with direct current traction system. The first Ganz made asynchronous rail vehicles (altogether 2 pieces) were supplied in 1898 to \u00c9vian-les-Bains\n(Switzerland), with a 37-horsepower (28 kW), asynchronous-traction system. The Ganz Works won the tender of electrification of railway of Valtellina Railways in Italy in 1897. Italian railways were the first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line, rather than just a short stretch. The 106-kilometre (66 mi) Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kand\u00f3 and a team from the Ganz works.[50]\nThe electrical system was three-phase at 3 kV 15 Hz. The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier, and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices.[51]\n[52]\nIn 1918,[53]\nKand\u00f3 invented and developed the rotary phase converter\n, enabling electric locomotives to use three-phase motors whilst supplied via a single overhead wire, carrying the simple industrial frequency (50 Hz) single phase AC of the high voltage national networks.[54]\nElectrified railway lines[edit\n]\nBudapest (See: BH\u00c9V\n): R\u00e1ckeve\nline (1887), Szentendre\nline (1888), G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151\nline (1888), Csepel\nline (1912)[55]\nElectrified tramways[edit\n]\nThe first electric tramway was built in Budapest in 1887, which was the first tramway in Austria-Hungary. By the turn of the 20th century, 22 Hungarian cities had electrified tramway lines in Kingdom of Hungary.\nDate of electrification of tramway lines in the Kingdom of Hungary:\nHungary: Budapest\n(1887); Pressburg/Pozsony/Bratislava\n(1895); Szabadka/Subotica\n, Szombathely\n, Miskolc\n(1897); Temesv\u00e1r/Timi\u0219oara\n(1899); Sopron\n(1900); Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti/Satu Mare\n(1900); Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za\n(1905); Nagyszeben/Sibiu\n(1905); Nagyv\u00e1rad/Oradea\n(1906); Szeged\n(1908); Debrecen\n(1911); \u00dajvid\u00e9k/Novi Sad\n(1911); Kassa/Ko\u0161ice\n(1913); P\u00e9cs\n(1913)\nCroatia: Fiume\n(1899); Pula\n(1904); Opatija\n\u2013 Lovran\n(1908); Zagreb\n(1910); Dubrovnik\n(1910).[56]\n[57]\n[58]\n[59]\nUnderground[edit\n]\nThe Budapest metro\nLine 1 (originally the \"Franz Joseph Underground Electric Railway Company\") is the second oldest underground railway in the world\n[60]\n(the first being the London Underground's Metropolitan Line), and the first on the European mainland. It was built from 1894 to 1896 and opened in Budapest on 2 May 1896.[61]\nIn 2002, it was listed as a UNESCO\nWorld Heritage Site\n.[62]\nAeronautical industry\nThe first Hungarian hydrogen-filled experimental balloons were built by Istv\u00e1n Szabik and J\u00f3zsef Domin in 1784. The first Hungarian designed and produced airplane (powered by inline engine\n) was flew in 1909 at R\u00e1kosmez\u0151.\n[69]\nThe International Air-race was organized in Budapest, R\u00e1kosmez\u0151 in June 1910. The earliest Hungarian radial engine\npowered airplane was built in 1913. Between 1913\u201318, the Hungarian aircraft industry began developing. The 3 greatest: UFAG\nHungarian Aircraft Factory (1914), Hungarian General Aircraft Factory (1916), Hungarian Lloyd Aircraft, Engine Factory (at Asz\u00f3d\n(1916),[70]\nand Marta in Arad (1914).[71]\nDuring the WW I, fighter planes, bombers and reconnaissance planes were produced in these factories. The most important aeroengine factories were Weiss Manfred Works, GANZ Works, and Hungarian Automobile Joint-stock Company Arad.\nThe first Hungarian steamship was built by Antal Bernhard in 1817, called S.S. Carolina. It was also the first steamship in Habsburg-ruled states.\n[109]\nSHIPBUILDING\nThe daily passenger traffic between the two sides of the Danube\nby the Carolina started in 1820.\n[110]\nThe regular cargo and passenger transports between Pest\nand Vienna\nbegan in 1831.\n[109]\nHowever, it was Count Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi\n(with the help of Austrian ship's company Erste Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft\n(DDSG) ), who established the \u00d3buda Shipyard on the Hungarian Haj\u00f3gy\u00e1ri Island\nin 1835, which was the first industrial scale steamship building company in the Habsburg Empire.\n[111]\nThe most important seaport for the Hungarian part of the k.u.k. was Fiume (Rijeka\n, today part of Croatia), where the Hungarian shipping companies, such as the Adria, operated. The largest Hungarian shipbuilding company was the Ganz-Danubius. In 1911, The Ganz Company merged with the Danubius shipbuilding company, which largest shipbuilding company in Hungary. Since 1911, the unified company adopted the \"Ganz \u2013 Danubius\" brand name. As Ganz Danubius, the company became involved in shipbuilding before, and during, World War I\n. Ganz was responsible for building the dreadnought Szent Istv\u00e1n\n, supplied the machinery for the cruiser Novara\n.\nDiesel-electric military submarines:\nThe Ganz-Danubius company started to build U-boats\nat its shipyard in Budapest\n, for final assembly at Fiume\n. Several U-Boats of the U-XXIX class\n, U-XXX class\n, U-XXXI class\nand U-XXXII class\nwere completed ,\n[112]\nand a number of other types were laid down, remaining incomplete at the war's end.\n[113]\nThe company built some ocean liners\ntoo.\nIn 1915, the Whitehead\ncompany established one of its largest enterprise, the Hungarian Submarine Building Corporation (or in its German name: Ungarische Unterseebotsbau AG (UBAG)), in Fiume, Kingdom of Hungary (Now Rijeka\n, Croatia).\n[114]\n[115]\nSM U-XX\n, SM U-XXI\n, SM U-XXII\nand SM U-XXIII\nType diesel-electric submarines were produced by the UBAG Corporation in Fiume.\n[116]\n[117]", "Surely it\u2019s a joke. Czechia (and especially Bohemia, its Western 60% around Prague) was the first (and the most) industrialized region of Austria-Hungary. The industrialization already exploded around 1850. (In England, industrialization formally started in the 1780s but was only substantial in the 1830s and 1840s.) Hungary (in the modern sense) was one of the least industrial places, even less industrial than Slovakia (then called \u201cUpper Hungary\u201d).\nFor example, \u0160koda Works\nthat would soon become the largest factory of Austria-Hungary was founded in 1859. It produced things like guns, machine guns, turbines, locomotives, aircraft, ships, machine tools, and more. In 1925, the company would buy Laurin & Klement, the carmaker founded in 1895 which became \u0160koda Auto (now owned by the Volkswagen Group). Check some historical videos of Czechia\u2019s currently most important company: history of skoda auto\nThis is the Pr\u00e4sident\n, the first car (it was a petrol-engined one) produced on the Czech territory, in 1897. The company would become Tatra soon. Incidentally, the first airplane built in Czechia was a hobby by Methodius Vlach, a man in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, incidentally the same town where \u0160koda Auto resides today. He built it in 1912.\nThere was no \u201celectronics\u201d before 1914, surely it wasn\u2019t meant seriously. The first \u201celectronic\u201d devices were huge and contained relays and then electron tubes. Only when transistors replaced those two (after a 1947 invention), a miniaturization started in electronics. Long after 1914.\nThe first Hungarian cars were produced by the Csonka (automobile)\nsince 1909. It\u2019s a decade after Czechia but the volumes and other things were smaller than the Czech counterparts, and there was virtually no industrialization in Hungary in the 19th century, about a 50-year-long delay after Czechia.\nThis industrial gap in favor of Czechia is even more spectacular when you look at airplanes (despite the fact that the Czechoslovak airplanes were a discipline in which Czechoslovakia was inferior relatively to Germany in the 1930s). The first airworthy Hungarian airplane, Rubik R-22 Fut\u00e1r\n, was built by Ern\u00f6 Rubik (the father of the father of the Rubik\u2019s cube) in 1948, 36 years after the first Czech airplane. Hungary remained underdeveloped in the aircraft industry up to the present.\nOrion and Videoton became the leading Hungarian electronics companies. Throughout much of the 20th century, most of Czechoslovakia\u2019s electronics production was accumulated in the chain of factories Tesla (Czechoslovak company)\nand I believe that the overall production was much higher than in Hungary. Tesla has been making tons of consumer electronics, tape recorders, home computers with their own version of the 8080 chips, and thousands of other products. But electronics really kicked off after the Second World War, not before 1914.\nFor more general comparisons \u201cwho is better\u201d among the two nations, see What does Czechia do better than Hungary? and especially What does Hungary do better than Czechia?", "Your question surprises me because I have always learned in school and from books that Czechia developed in a more modern, industrialized direction than Hungary did."], "topic_list": ["Hungarian Trolls", "Industrialization", "Czechia (country)", "Industrial Revolution", "The Czech Republic", "Economic History", "History"], "view_list": [15, 252, 35, 2, 84, 603, 32], "create_time": "Jan 25, 2020", "no_of_follower": 10, "question_author": "Csongor Csillog\u00f3", "upvote_list": [3, 11, 0, 0, 1, 21, 5], "question_title": "Why was Czechia unable to develop the modern second industrial revolution sectors of the industry in the 1870-1914 period, while Hungary was more successful in this modern industry (like electronic industry, ICE engines, cars, etc.)?", "respond_collected": 7, "no_of_view": "1,556", "name_list": ["Vaclav Sulista", "Vladim\u00edr Hirsch", "Bob Gartside", "Gustaf Johansson", "Csongor Csillog\u00f3", "Lubo\u0161 Motl", "P\u00e9ter Wellisch"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Mar 19, 2020", "Mar 19, 2020", "Mar 17, 2020", "Mar 17, 2020", "Mar 17, 2020", "Mar 8, 2020"]}, "656": {"ans_list": ["I think that there still exist Hungarians being devastated after losing Transylvania 100 years ago.

Even more so if you are a multi-ethnic state with a small elite ruling class and unhappy minorities chafing for independence.", "This goes back to hundreds of years ago. France and Germany have rivalized and fought each other for centuries. France wanted to permanently destroy its opponent, but because Germany was ethnically too homogeneous, this was not possible. (After World War II, Germany was also been divided, but ethnic unity allowed the reunification 45 years later.) France\u2019s idea was If you can't defeat someone, defeat his strongest ally! During the First World War (and before), Germany's strongest military ally was the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Referring to the freedom rights of the ethnicities (Fourteen Points of Wilson), the Entente states under the leadership of France, divided Austria-Hungary to smaller parts. \"Divide and conquer.\" France referred to the ethnicity's rights for self-determination, but the new borders did not take into account the Hungarian ethnicity, and 100% Hungarian-inhabited territories came under foreign rule, where Hungarians became an oppressed minority without any kind of ethnic rights on their former territories. It seems that France was only interested in the rights of non-Hungarian minorities. The new borders were designed strictly by economic and political interests. A good example is the town of S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely in north-eastern Hungary, which was chopped half by the new border. The railway station and network with surrounding Hungarian villages were annexed to Czechoslovakia, while the rest of the town remained Hungarian. Despite Mr. Draculea's nationalist-chauvinistic lies, there weren\u2019t democratic elections (except in 1 case), and the local population wasn\u2019t being asked, where they wanted to belong. There was an election 1 year after the peace treaty, in Sopron, where the population voted to remain in Hungary, so Hungary got back the town and the surrounding area. The nickname of this town is \u201cThe most loyal town\u201d now. After this event, the defenders of democracy and human rights (USA, France, UK) prohibited further elections, because they worried the local population would vote to be part of Hungary again, so no further elections were held anywhere else. There was an event at Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (today Alba Iulia, Romania) in 1918. The Romanians always refer to it as a democratic election, but actually it wasn\u2019t. The 1228 delegates who declared the annexation of Transylvania to Romania were ethnic Romanians (600 from Transylvania, the rest from Romania). The local Hungarian and Saxon population was not being asked, can't vote, and they did not have a choice, to express their views. The Hungarian government proposed that Transylvania be transformed into a Swiss-type confederation of cantons, where all ethnic groups are equally represented, but the Romanian government refused it, and they announced the unification. The Entente powers approved the event, and nowadays, the Romanian governments (and peoples) still like to present the events to the neutral public as a result of a democratic election.", "Because the native population in the lands that left Hungary did not want to be part of Hungary (which had a long history of opressing them) so they voted for independence, either forming their own nations or joining others."], "topic_list": ["History of Hungary", "Hungary", "World War I", "History"], "view_list": [3, 98, 153, 677, 97], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Anonymous", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 2, 4, 3], "question_title": "Why was Hungary divided into several nations after World War I?", "respond_collected": 5, "no_of_view": "1,949", "name_list": ["Rasvan Lalu", "Attila Horvath", "Niko Vasileas", "August Mackensen", "Antoniu Draculea"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"]}, "560": {"ans_list": ["I think it\u2019s more accurate if I describe more of how the impeachment process worked in ancient China, it was similar but not quite the same as the modern concept.\nImpeachment was not just done by any magistrates or officials. There was a special position called \u201cyushi,\u201d (\u5fa1\u53f2) or sometimes categorised as \u201cspeaker officials,\u201d (\u8a00\u5b98) whose duties were to do this. Their role was to exhibit some degree of supervision to other politicians or the Emperor himself. If an official that was not a yushi wrote an impeachment request to the Emperor, the Emperor \u201cmight\u201d accept it. Or he might just tell him off by saying \u201cThis power is not in your normal duty.\u201d\nIf the yushi suspect any corruption or miscarriage of justice, they have the power to collect evidence and write to the Emperor to report this. They might also recommend appropriate punishment to the impeached official, such as demotion, dismissal or even criminal sentences.\nIn rare circumstances, they might also impeach the Emperor. However, this form of impeachment was done for the purpose of recommending the Emperor to change on certain policies for improvement. It was borderline high treason to impeach the Emperor to abdicate, because usually this was only done if the Emperor was a puppet ruler that could be easily disposed.\nWhat were the usual results of the impeachment?\nIf what the yushi wrote was accurate, with evidence provided, and logically sound, the Emperor would accept his suggestion and order for a formal investigation or a punishment. However, if the impeachment was not adequate or inconclusive, the yushi himself might get into trouble. He would possibly be punished for libel/defamation, or the officials he impeached would attempt to end his political career.\nStereotypically, this was why yushi were often seen as wise, honourable and good with words. However, politics always had that \u201cMidas touch,\u201d to turn something clean into something vile.\nA yushi himself might be politically aligned with certain people. His impeachment might selectively target people who were his political enemies, but when his political allies commit such acts he would conveniently ignore it. He could also be privately ordered by other officials to make this impeachment process.\nCase study: the fall of Yan Song\nFor example, during the reign of Jiajing Emperor of Ming, the government was controlled by the corrupt grand secretary Yan Song and his son Yan Shifan, who were often sarcastically called \u201cThe Senior and Junior Prime Minister.\u201d The yushi Zou Yinglong, after consulting with rival grand secretary Xu Jie, wrote an impeachment process to the Emperor, but centred it on Yan Shifan abusing his power to have \u201cinappropriate relations during national mourning.\u201d\nWhen one impeachment came, others soon followed. Several other yushi wrote their impeachment of the Yan family too. However, Xu Jie saw that they were accusing Yan family of miscarriage of justice by executing several politicians. Xu Jie asked them to rewrite it, because even if the Yan family falsified evidence to kill rival politicians, the \u201cdeath warrant\u201d was ultimately signed by the Emperor, and they couldn\u2019t be pointing any blames on him.\nThey ultimately settled on a very hand-waving verdict for the impeachment of Yan Shifan: treason by colluding with wukou (Japanese pirates). Which worked out very well and got the Yan family toppled. Yan Shifan was sentenced to death and Yan Song was demoted to a commoner, living the remainder of his life in poverty.\nPolitics was and is always a dirty game, and impeachment was never truly for simple justice. Still, in the case of Yan Song, because he was a notoriously corrupt politician in Ming history, most historians agree he got what he deserved.", "Han Wudi\u2019s grandson was declared unfit as emperor by the magistrate He Guang, a descendent of Han Wudi General He Qubin.

The modern idea of impeachment is a formal proceeding that could result in the removal of the administrative head, and there is nothing like that in ancient China.\n\u2018Impeachment\u2019 would be an attempt to translate the Chinese idea that the emperor had been wrong, unethical, incompetent, or corrupt. The emperor might accept the accusation and blamed himself. This could occur after some catastrophe happened (e.g. famine, flood, earthquakes, or other natural disasters). However, there was no mechanism in place to remove the emperor after some official pointed this out. The emperor could also punish the official, e.g. killing him, for making such daring accusations against him, which occurred more often than not. If it were an impeachment, it would not be such a high stakes game for the officials involved.\nA coup of some sort was required to remove the emperor, and there was no accepted mechanism in place to do that. After a coup succeeded, there might be some official announcement of how bad the old emperor was to legitimize changing the emperor, but it is post facto, and completely different in nature from an impeachment.", "No, certainly not any Chinese emperors had ever been impeached.\nImpeachment is a peaceful process by law to strip the power of a ruler because of his/her wrong doing. In ancient China, there were several emperors who were forced out and gave the power to the members of their family. But, these are not cases of impeachment. They were coups or infightings no matter how seemly these emperors were forced out for wrong doing. Most, if not all, emperors would be considered criminals if they were subjected to the laws.\nIf you saw a record of such a case of impeachment, I would be very interested to read it.", "When I think of ancient China, I think of the period before the Han dynasty.\nLooking back at Chinese history, before or after the Han, I\u2019m not sure what you mean by impeachment. China did not have a constitution, so there were no laws for impeachment in the American sense.\nAn impeached American president retires to private life. This rarely happened to emperors in China.\nUsually what happened was more like a coup. A group of politicians would be dissatisfied with an emperor for a variety of reasons. The Emperor may have been incompetent, or some politician could have grown too powerful and decided to mount the throne himself. A member of the royal family might want to take power. These were not impeachments for high misdemeanors or treason, such as President Trump has committed, but rather someone taking over the power, usually violently.

FDR was far more concerned with getting India free of British control and was basically oblivious to Stalin's land hunger and mendacity, until FDR finally woke up and realized that \u201cStalin lied to me about everything!\u201d Of course, by then it was far too late; the Red Army controlled things and to dislodge them would take World War III, and while this would have made George Patton happier than a pig in mud, this was not what the British and American people would possibly support, since millions of new deaths would not be anything but a catstrophe for mankind.", "When the three met in Tehran, Stalin was extremely nervous and his attitude was quite defensive.. You can understand that, if you consider that he had been promised a 2nd front and by then the promise wasn't delivered on.

In fact she provided us with one of the greatest Queens this country has ever had. Anne's downfall however came after her manipulations had pissed off one too many important people and they managed to convince the King that she'd been shagging both her brother and the bloke who played the guitar thingy in her court.

I can only add that the emphasis on Catherine of Aragon\u2019s connections cannot be underplayed. Anne had no such backers.

It wasn\u2019t his idea to execute Anne. He intended to divorce Anne too. But, he was advised, by Thomas Cromwell I think, that another divorce just wouldn\u2019t go down well. He had already used the idea of incest to get rid of Katherine, so another reason for divorce would need to be found. Why not just say she committed adultery which was treason and punishable by death. By that time, Katherine was already deceased. With both former queens dead, there was no reason he wouldn\u2019t be able to marry Jane Seymour.", "Catherine had been Henry\u2019s faithful wife since 1509. She had borne him six children, three stillborn and two died in infancy, so sadly only the Princess Mary survived. Catherine had put up with Henry\u2019s numerous adulteries and infidelities with women of the court. She was in her own right a Spanish Princess, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, and her uncle was the Emperor Charles V, who ruled the Habsburg Lands in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.\nWhen Henry took up with his new paramour Ann Boleyn, who had seen her older sister Mary royally screwed and cast aside, Ann was more shrewd and insisted on marrying Henry and becoming Queen. But it was a dangerous game.\nIt was one thing for Henry to petition the Pope (unsuccessfully) for the annulment of his 20-year marriage to Catherine. It would have been quite another for him to have had her head cut off. It was bad enough that he was prepared to drag the English Church into schism from Rome, and put to death the bravest and holiest in the land who opposed him.\nAs we know, sauce for Catherine\u2019s goose soon turned into sauce for Ann\u2019s gander.\nAnn was victoriously married to Henry on 25 January 1533, having already conceived Elizabeth outside marriage. She was crowned Queen on 1 June 1533, a status she would enjoy for less than three years.\nShe fell foul of the Machiavellian Cromwell, over how the monies plundered from the monasteries should be used. Ann, to her credit, wanted some of the wealth to go towards schools and hospitals. Cromwell wanted it for his Treasury.\nThe trumped up charges against Ann were that she had had sexual relationships with five courtiers, including her brother, George Boleyn (aka Lord Rochford), and the king\u2019s good friend and groom of the stool, Sir Henry Norris. According to the indictments, not only had she slept with these men (as a result of her \u201cfrail and carnal appetites\u201d), but she had also conspired with them to kill her husband, the king.\nAnn had no powerful foreign protectors. Her blissful marital union with the King came to an abrupt end on 19th May 1536 when her head was lopped off. The Boleyn family had ridden high upon their in-law connection to His Majesty. Now they were disgraced, dismissed from Court, and there was no comeback.\nThe next day, 20th May, Jane Seymour and King Henry VIII were betrothed. He wasn\u2019t one to hang about when he wanted a leg over. On 30th May, only eleven days after Ann\u2019s execution, they were married in a private ceremony in the Palace of Whitehall. Catherine had died on 7th January 1536, to the King\u2019s delight, so he was free to marry no problems after Ann\u2019s precipitous demise.", "Because Catherine was from a very powerful family\u2026.\nCatherine's parents were Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon, the monarchs who\u2019s marriage created the country that we now know as Spain. At the time of Catherine\u2019s divorce from Henry, her sister Joanna was ruler of Castile and Aragon; her nephew Maximilian was Holy Roman Emperor; and her nephew John was King Of Portugal. The divorce alone caused major diplomatic issues for Henry - if he had executed Catherine, he would have sparked a war against most of continental Europe, with very little chance of survival, let alone victory.", "Catherine had been Henry\u2019s wife, and the Queen, for more than twenty years. And she was almost universally loved by the people of England. She was of Royal blood herself, and her behavior as Queen had been beyond reproach.\nIf Henry had tried to trump up bogus charges against her, as he did with Anne, he would have had a rebellion on his hands, and he knew it. So did Cromwell. And the backlash from Catholic Europe would have been far greater than it was when he exiled Catherine. Spain might have declared war on Henry to defend the rights of Catherine and her daughter Mary.\nThe only claim Henry was able to make against Catherine was that her marriage to Arthur had been consummated, and thus her marriage to Henry had never been valid. The problem with that was that the papal dispensation he had received to marry her stated that their marriage had the blessing of God and the Church whether or not her union with Arthur had been consummated.\nTrying to discard Catherine was bad enough in the eyes of the world\u2026executing her would have been political and religious suicide. It would have been seen as the murder of a Queen, and Henry might have been excommunicated for it.", "Because Catherine was related to the Holy Roman Emperor (his niece) who would have obviously gone to war with England (and probably win).", "Because Anne Boleyn was believed to have attempted to have sex with her brother in order to re-conceive after having yet another miscarriage."], "topic_list": ["Catherine of Aragon", "Mary I of England (historical figure)", "Anne Boleyn (historical figure)", "Elizabeth I of England (historical figure)", "King Henry VIII (historical figure)", "History of the United Kingdom", "History of Great Britain", "History"], "view_list": [437, 375, 9, 56, 100, 297, 181, 153, 0, 147, 0, 73, 3], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Christopher Sasono", "upvote_list": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], "question_title": "Why was Anne Boleyn executed and Catherine of Aragon not?

The stereotypical image of stamped metal swords are of course the later variant due to scarcity of materials.\nEarlier Gunto swords were by and large just actual traditional samurai swords worn by officers, but they were already starting to manufacture newer swords at an industrial level to furnish the officer corps of the imperial Japanese Army/ Navy- as some officers came from the older samurai class and had heirlooms, it made sense for them to forego Gunto swords and bring along their forefather\u2019s weapons.\nThe mid-war and late-war variants were of course gradual simplification in design and manufacture, and as you would expect the quality became increasingly low.\nSo no, Gunto swords manufactured as such, as a rule were not made in the traditional forging process, but machined in factories. Note, however, that much of the simplification revolved more around the scabbard and hilt, rather than the blade; only the final versions utilized stainless steel; it seems Gunto blades\u2019 quality remained rather consistent.\nI should also note that, automated and industrial scale manufacturing of swords don\u2019t imply loss of quality- hand-forged swords were merely just that, forged by hands and took longer labour.

Outside Japan, they have become collector items, though.\nNowadays, there are swordsmiths who will handcraft these swords again.But they are now also created outside Japan, often with even slightly stronger kinds of steel.\nHow the WWII swords compared to the older Samurai swords? Well, the quality was good enough for the Japanese. The mechanized production methods did allow the new swords to be just as strong as the older katana. It all depends on the quality of the steel itself. It\u2019s a bit like comparing glass bottles made by hand and glass bottles made my factories and various machinery. They would both serve their purpose just fine, but the handmade stuff is way more expensive and harder to get, thus considered to be an elite product.\nThe machine-made swords could have a few more weaknesses within the steel, though. Weaknesses that would become apparent with heavy usage. But WWII did not have that many sword fights anymore and these swords were generally just used as last resort or for decapitation of prisoners.\nIt is also interesting to know that a swordsmith starts with generating a straight blade for his sword. The blade will only have one sharp edge and it is hardened in a way that makes the edged part expand a bit more than the blunt side, resulting in the curve of the sword.

Even collectively, they are not even in the same league.\nGenghis Khan\nAnyone who disagrees has probably forgotten about the fate of the Khwarezmians. Now the Khwarezmians were not a Persian dynasty. Nor Iranic. They were a Turkic Dynasty. However the majority of the people in their empire are believed to have been Iranic. Genghis Khan\u2019s invasion caused a change in demographics permanently in Central Asia. Afterwards, the Turko-Mongol groups became the largest group in the region. Instead of Iranic.\nFor a more detailed account of the matter - Ahmad Abubakr (\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0628\u06a9\u0631)'s answer to Who are the most important people that historians largely forgot?\nHere is a brief summary of what the Mongols under the rule of Genghis Khan did to the Khwarezmians. Entire cities such as Nishapur were put to the sword and pyramids were constructed out of their skulls. Even the animals were not spared. Urgench, one of the greatest cities of Central Asia, was depopulated. After it\u2019s conquest, most of the people were killed. The women and children taken as slaves. The best example of this brutality is probably the conquest of Merv. Merv was the last safe haven for thousands of refugees who had nowhere else to go. This was no great city of soldiers and warriors. Soon after being besieged, the governor surrendered on the condition that his people would be spared. The Mongols broke their promise as soon as the city was turned over. Every living soul in the city was butchered, most of them were refugees who had fled from other regions. The city was razed to the ground. Merv, one of the greatest Central Asian cities for a thousand years, was turned into nothing. The Mongol invasions are also believed to have been responsible for desertification of some areas.\nThis is all that remains of Merv\nMany historians believe that about 90% of the Khwarezmian populated was wiped out during this genocide. The population of the region dropped from over 2.5 million to about 200,000. Imagine destruction to such an extent, that the demographics of such a large area were changed forever. The destruction of the Khwarezmian Empire and it\u2019s people is one of the most bloody and brutal events throughout human history. Very few things even lie in the same league as this.\nAs I said before, this is not even a competition. Genghis Khan was far more brutal than the rest combined.", "By far, Genghis Khan was the most brutal and savage towards Iranian. legend has it that the Mongols did not even have mercy on cats and dogs. They slaughtered those who resisted the invasion including all men women, children and their animals.\n\u201cAccording to the works of the Iranian historian Rashid al-Din\n(1247\u20131318), the Mongols\nkilled more than 700,000 people in Merv\nand more than a million in Nishapur\n.

They decided to count years from the birth of Christ. That, to them, was the essential \u201cdate\u201d to base years on. As we have seen, the Romans decided their essential date was the founding of Rome and the Jews decided the creation of the world was the essential date. Other cultures have had other essential dates to begin counting.", "Q: How did people in ancient civilizations know they were in years 2 B.C. and 2 A.D. without modern science?\nFirst, there are many more calendars than the Gregorian calendar used by Christians. And there have been many more that no one uses today. The Gregorian calendar says it is 2020 AD (anno domini). It can also be called 2020 CE (common era). Before the Gregorian calendar Christians used the Julian calendar\u2026 well, the Gregorian calendar is really the Julian calendar with some fixes.\nThe traditional Chinese calendar says it\u2019s 4714.\nThe Buddhist calendar says it\u2019s 2560.\nThe Byzantine calendar, also based on the Julian calendar, says it is 7526.\nThe Ethiopian calendar, which is similar to the Julian calendar, says it is 2010.\nThe Hebrew calendar says 5778.\nThe Holocene calendar, which uses the beginning of the Human Era (HE) randomly chose 10,000 BCE (before common era) as the start date and, therefore, it is the year 12018.\nThe Islamic calendar says it is 1439.\nThe Japanese calendar says it is Heisei 30. 30? Yes, because their calendar counts from the reign of the current Emperor. Many older calendar systems did this as well.\nThe ancient Roman calendar was weird. The Senate could decide how many days were in a year so politics could get involved. Plus, they usually added days that to keep the seasons and months lined up with nature instead of having leap days. I\u2019m not sure what year it is.\nThe Thai Solar calendar says it\u2019s 2561.\nAnd there are many other calendars. The \u2018year\u2019 is just a number. Someone came up with a way of counting days, months, years, eras, etc and other people say, \u201cokay, we\u2019ll use that.\u201d\nTo understand the AD/BC counting system, you have to understand that the idea came about because Christian church leaders wanted to figure out when Easter should be celebrated. The First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD decided that Easter would fall on the Sunday following the full moon that follows the Spring Equinox. It\u2019s basically Passover for Christians but they needed a way to define when it should be celebrated by everyone in the Christian church.\nA guy by the name of Dionysus Exiguus came up with a system to calculate Easter. He wasn\u2019t the first but he created his \u201cEaster table\u201d (the list of calculated dates) and called it \u201cAnno Domini 532\u201d. The previous year had been calculated using a different system so it was called \u201cAnno Diocletiana 247\u201d, which had been named after a ruthless emperor who had persecuted Christians. It was his way of showing how he felt about the former emperor.\nDionysus never said how he calculated the date of Jesus\u2019 birth so everyone just had to accept he knew what he was doing. He was kinda close but research since has shown he was off. But, by that time, everyone agreed on the year so why change it?\nSo, a \u2018year\u2019 is just a number you happen to use now. People didn\u2019t think of 2 AD versus 2 BC because no one came up with that idea for several hundred years.", "The whole B.C. and A.D. is NOT the only calendar system in the world: It is the one most used today, that is all.\nB.C. and A.D. are based on Christianity: B.C. being \u201cBefore Christ\" and A.D. being \u201cAnno Domini\" which is latin for \u201cYear Of The Lord\". Other cultures and religions have their own calendar systems. Like the jewish calendar which uses a different start time than BC/AD. And in countries like japan and china they have a calendar system symbolized by animals. Such as \u201cYear Of The Horse\" and \u201cYear Of The Dragon\" which structurally is different from BC/AD.\nIn the far past, the origin point of the many calendars of ancient civilizations were most likely based on the founding of their culture, the reign of their kings, or another system we know nothing about today.\nSo, ancient people couldn't know about AD and BC any more than we today can know about \u201cThe Fifth Year Of The Reign Of King Karnezer\" or whatever calendar system the future inhabitants of Mars creates.", "The concept of AD didn\u2019t come around until later. It\u2019s an abbreviation of Anno Domini, or \u201cin the year of the Lord\u201d. People used other dating systems at the time, such as the year of the king or emperor\u2019s reign, or from when they thought the world was created.", "They didn't.\nDid you know it's 2563\nin Thailand? Of course not! For whatever reason you think Khufu wanted his pyramid built by 2560BC!\nYou also, for reasons unknown, seem to think the miscount from the birth of the Christian Messiah is somehow a scientific theory? Modern scientists have a far more useful scale using years Before Present.\nAs I have demonstrated, different cultures had, and still have, different calendars.", "The system was adopted way later, how could people before Christ know they lived before the brith of a man who was obviously not born at that time ?", "They didn\u2019t. The first time we know anyone started naming years based on the birth of Jesus is in 525. It wasn\u2019t widely adopted until almost 300 years later. So, the \u201cancient civilizations\u201d didn\u2019t claim to be in a year based on the birth of Jesus.", "They didn\u2019t - those calendar concepts didn\u2019t arise until late antiquity. But they did know what date it was, according to whatever calendar they used.\nYou don\u2019t need \u201cmodern science\u201d to know what date it is. All you need is a set starting point, and daily markings. Even scratches on the cave wall will do. Gather enough scratches to count a year, mark a passing year, start again. If you lose track, or don\u2019t know how many days are in a year, just wait until a recurring astronomical event, like an equinox, to reset the count - and humans knew how to track these already in Stone Age.", "Simple, they cannot because that particular calendar system was invented in 525 C.E.\nThe Anno Domini dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus to enumerate the years in his Easter table. His system was to replace the Diocletian era that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.[10] The last year of the old table, Diocletian Anno Martyrium 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, Anno Domini 532. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year\u2014he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of Probus Junior\", which was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ\".[11] Thus Dionysius implied that Jesus' incarnation occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred. \"However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, Olympiad, year of the world, or regnal year of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date.\"[12]\nAnno Domini - Wikipedia\nAny civilization at the time would have their own calendar.

There are accounts of the worldwide Biblical flood ALL OVER THE WORLD!\nChina was founded by a grandson of Noah.

Then he sends a dove out which returns with a birch twig.\nThe country of India has many flood legends.\nAnswers in Genesis\nhas books on the worldwide flood with narratives and charts regarding flood stories all over the world. I, myself, have the book called The Flood of Noah which lists stories of the worldwide flood from all continents except Antartica. It is amazing that there are so many with the same details of exactly eight human survivors and how they are related to each other, saved land animals in the ark/boat, 40 days of rain, angry God,,,\nThere are many fanciful and fictional tales as well, but the fact that ALL ancient cultres seem to have a worldwide flood story and that several of these stories have the SAME details as the Bible indicates that there must have been a REAL EVENT that triggered all these stories. Since, ancient people separated by language and geography with no means to communicate could all make-up the SAME story and the ones that have the same details, the same details.\nEven Alaska and Hawaii, so far removed from the Middle East have almost the same names and details!\nThere are so many bibliographies and websites I could site for more information but Answers in Genesis is a great start.

Matsya (the incarnation of Lord Vishnu as a fish) forewarns Manu (a human) about an impending catastrophic flood and orders him to collect all the grains of the world in a boat; in some forms of the story, all living creatures are also to be preserved in the boat. When the flood destroys the world, Manu \u2013 in some versions accompanied by the seven great sages \u2013 survives by boarding the ark, which Matsya pulls to safety.\nPuluga\n, the creator god in the religion of the indigenous inhabitants of the Andaman Islands\n, sends a devastating flood to punish people who have forgotten his commands.

And they decided Mozzarella is the best Cheese and perfect for the Pizza.\nItalian Cheeses are a class of its own, and Mozzarella comes under the category it is called the Pasta Filata category, which means stretched curd.\nThe making process of Pasta Filata type cheeses is altogether different than the rest of the cheeses.\nThe most significant characteristic of Cheese on Pizza must be it should not oil off, and Mozzarella's unique process allows it. And the second characteristic of Italians wanted it, and the Cheese should be elastic and stretch when eating the Pizza. That is also built in the Cheese, the third characteristic of the Cheese must be it should not interfere with the authentic flavor of the cheese, Mozzarella is the cheese which is made with a neutral flavor. We in cheese technology call it washed curd cheese, which means one step in the process curd is washed to reduce lactose in the curd to tame down other flavor development in cheese.\nLet me summarize: Mozzarella is the cheese specifically developed for Pizza, it has to have three characteristics.\nCheese should not oil off, in puddles on the Pizza.\nCheese must be stretchable, not rigid like plastic.\nCheese should not interfere with the authentic flavor/taste of the Pizza.\nONLY Italians originally knew the art of science of Pasta Filata type of cheese, and they perfected it over the centuries. Even today, most of the Pasta Filata type plants are manufactured in Italy. And there is no match for their knowledge in this field of Italian Cheeses.\nIn my career, I have audited two of the largest Mozzarella plants in the world, and in both, there was test kitchen including state of the art testing laboratories. All staffed with very qualified personnel.\nIn these plants, Mozzarella cheese was baked on the pizza, before it was released for sale.\nI hope it helps.\nIn case you live in Canada, 100 percent chance that you must have eaten Pizza at least once coming out that plant/company where I had worked.

It ended up reducing the monetary supply by around 30%. Ouch. Not what you want to do in a depression. FDR, a Democrat, came in and reversed things, flooding the economy with money, though likely not enough. Although this isn\u2019t strictly a Republican-caused event, the Republican Party is inextricably linked to austerity economics, so I include it here. (Democrats also like to use austerity economics too, last used under Bill Clinton, who ended up causing the recession under George Bush, Sr. Including this here not due to historical accuracy, but due to the arc of history now bending in the progressive\u2019s favor; Republicans favor austerity measures and future Republican bills will likely look to reduce Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security to pay for the COVID response.\nSocial Security began under FDR in 1935 as a Democratic response to the needs of America\u2019s elderly.\nPublic Works Projects instituted by FDR built many dam projects and was also responsible for many parks projects which many of us enjoy to this day. The many different projects were designed for relief of the many unemployed throughout the country.\nRegulation in the Great Depression was ratcheted up, forcing banks to be more responsible and lessening the likelihood of more economic failures. Securities also were regulated. Regulation of the environment, creating protections to lessen pollution of our air and water, was part of the conservation movement which the Republicans were squarely backing. This however slackened over the years, and now environmental conservation has now been completely abandoned by the Republican Party. Future generations face a bleak future due to their Republican grandparents\u2019 failure to put conservation ahead of profits. Banking regulation also was begun once again under President Obama, but has since been dismantled under Trump and McConnell.\nFarm relief. Henry Wallace, as Agriculture Secretary, worked to support American farms. He was a socialist.\nCollective Bargaining. Democrats favored the rights of workers to form unions and thus enabled them to counter the one-sided contracting of labor.\nWorker Safety. Democrats have worked to increase the rights of workers to work under safe work conditions. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 forbade child labor and reduced the max work week hours. Minimum wage was set at 25 cents ($4.47 in 2020 dollars). You can thank a Democrat for weekends off, higher wages, and vacations.\nEnding discrimination. Democrats passed revolutionary anti-discrimination civil rights legislation in the 1960s.\nDemocrats passed Medicaid legislation as well as the formation of Medicare, both allowing for healthcare expansion.\nAlthough many presidents, both Republican and Democrat, spoke of expansion of healthcare, it was begun with Truman and reached critical mass under first Carter and then Clinton, all Democrats. It was finally achieved under Obama, another Democrat. Since 2009 the Republican Party has been assiduously attempting to remove health care coverage as a right for its citizens.\nVietnam began as a Democratic lie (Gulf of Tonkin incident) which propelled the country to support a war it could not win. Progressives rose up within the U.S. in response to this perceived unjust war and with Johnson\u2019s rising unpopularity forcing him to resign from his candidacy finally achieved the war\u2019s end under a Republican president. While begun under a Democratic president, the war was rejected by a liberal progressive movement. Turns out they were on the right side of history, as they were again during the\u2026\nIraq War. Americans again were lied to, this time by a Republican president (George Bush II). Over 4,400 American deaths occurred along with 32,000 wounded and between half a million to one million Iraqi casualties (civilian and armed forces).\nMarijuana reform. Say what you want, Democratic support for marijuana reform legislation has resulted in less imprisonment for lesser drug charges and for increased income for states. While prohibition (alcohol) was a non-partisan issue\u2014ended under a Democratic administration with some bipartisan support also, marijuana reform has been a cause for progressives for decades. It was bound to happen sooner or later.\nAddiction. Republican support for aiding addicts and support for addiction programs has been a journey fraught with friction. Addicts, to conservatives, are to blame. Poverty, too, is seen as a personal failure. Modern medicine and science has proven that addiction is societal and cultural and medical, with origins that are various but include corporate malfeasance and a lack of support structures to reduce poverty.\nThe Green New Deal. Unless we begin to look closely at another New Deal program, climate change will devastate the country\u2026and the entire planet. Republicans have denied the science for decades. Without Republican denialism we could have fixed this problem decades ago and saved a lot of money\u2026and people\u2019s lives.\nGay rights. Democrats, though certainly not always, achieved a liberal cultural shift by allowing gay marriage and gays to serve in the military. Some Republicans still to this day see homosexuality as a kind of disease or sin.\nDiversity and inclusion. Democrats see a diverse nation as one that thrives. All religions are welcome, while Republicans pretend there is but one: Evangelical Christianity with Zionism as a kind of silent partner. Democrats see a nation of Hispanics, Asians, Blacks, Native Americans as one that is strong. It sees a nation that permits Islam and Judaism and Christianity and Sikhism and Hinduism and others as completing the spiritual fabric of the country. The Republican Party now uses the Evangelical Church as a political weapon, even to the point of leveraging its power to end COVID-19 emergency measures and to increase pressure to allow every man, woman, and child to own at least one gun, preferably one that might be used in wartime.\nOn these topics the Democratic party and the progressive movement has been on the right side of history: economics, military actions, regulations, labor movement, social programs, healthcare. Once I realized this I switched from a Republican to a Democrat. I am only embarrassed I did not see this sooner.", "Please note that this answer is necessarily way too short to do the question justice. The Republican Party is in my opinion right on some things, some of the time, no question at all. It has always been right on SOME things of more or less importance. But it\u2019s been on the WRONG side quite often, and is on the WRONG side today on all the most critical issues as I see the issues personally.\nI repeat, The Republican Party has been on the right side at times, and it\u2019s right about some things today. Don\u2019t forget that neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party even existed as we know them today in the past, except as students of history. If you don\u2019t know the basics of American history, you don\u2019t know doo doo from apple butter about EITHER party\u2019s history.\nSo here\u2019s a history lesson written as fast and as short as possible.\nThe Republican Party dominated in the North during the Civil War Era and prosecuted that war to victory and thus freed the people held as slaves in the South. No question, a huge plus for the Party of Lincoln.\nThe dominant people of the south, namely the white folks, honkies like me, then embraced the Democratic Party and stuck with it like stink on shit right, up until the modern day Civil Rights Era was born. Most southerners from the Civil War period right on up to the fifties and sixties REALLY would rather have voted for yellow dog than for any Republican candidate.\nBut times changed, an the Democratic Party of the fifties and sixties in the rest of the country ( except the old south, or deep south) took up the cause of Civil Rights for minorities, who at that time were still mostly black people living in the south, although by then millions of blacks had moved to the North. Immigration back then was a potent political issue but nothing like what it is today, and there wasn\u2019t all that much attention being paid to the southern border and Mexico, etc.\nSo now we\u2019re into the time when today\u2019s older citizens were kids or young adults. With the Civil Rights Era coming into it\u2019s own, the Republicans saw their opening, and went whole hog for the white southern vote, successfully, simply by RUNNING AGAINST DEMOCRATS.\nIn the space of a few years, the formerly solid for the Democrats white people in the south switched their party loyalties. The southern states morphed in to the solid REPUBLICAN south, with the result that the south up is now pretty much OWNED by the Republican Party, because the white people of the south outnumber the blacks and other minorities at the state level and therefore control southern state governments. Racism and religion are the two primary keys to this sea change in American politics.\nThe Republicans have played the southern strategy game almost perfectly for the last sixty fifty or sixty years, suppressing the minority vote, catering to the religious and cultural values of most of my neighbors and indeed of my own extended family. Winning in the solid RED south enabled them to win nationally in presidential elections more often than not, and elect more Republican Senators and appoint more hard core conservative judges than otherwise, etc.\nBUT I\u2019m proud and happy to say that the SOUTH IS RISING AGAIN, and this time it\u2019s rising as a BETTER PLACE, with lots of elected black politicians, lots of black teachers, lots of black cops, with integrated schools, etc, this time around making the south a place I can be proud of. I should not forget to say we have some brown politicians, cops, lawyers and community leaders as well.\nMy own state of Virginia just went BLUE this last year!\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t have time at the moment to say anything about other critical aspects of party histories in this answer.I\u2019m leaving out such major issues as Social Security, national security, etc, all of which played critical roles in the history of our country.", "Yep, always.", "Nobody has the inalienable right to being right or wrong History should always be treated with caution as it is inevitably written by the victors or the most powerfull bystanders of the day", "Women\u2019s right to vote, the 8-hour work week, workplace safety enforcement, child-labor laws, minimum wage, civil rights\u2026these are just a few liberal advances, just off the top of my head, that the Republican Party opposed.

The \u201cbirthplace\u201d of the Chinese civilization was once filled with non-Sinitic people who spoke an unknown language and lived side by side some of the Sinitic tribes. These early proto-Sino-Tibetic settlers came to the western fringe of Yellow River basin and gradually expanded eastward, meeting the Dongyi in the east and a smaller \u201cAltaic\u201d group in the northeast. As competition over resources between these groups became fierce, these tribes began to form factions, by which time the proto-Sino-Tibetan people had already splintered off into two subgroups. The Sinitic tribes based out of the basin became unified under the confederacy between two chiefs\u2014Yan Di and Huang Di. The combined forces of the Sinids overwhelmed the Dongyi, defeating them and taking over their territory while assimilating defecting groups. The ancestors of the Chinese became militant in this period because of the threat of a common enemy and the need to acquire resources.\nThe Xia was succeeded by the Shang, who had a militant policy of raiding \u201cbarbarian neighbours\u201d that refused to give tribute and expanding its borders, during which foreign subjects were often captured in the process as human sacrifices. The warlikeness of the Shang and its cruel practices draw parallels with the Aztec of Mesoamerica, who also practiced live sacrifices. In this period, factors such as the Shang dynasty\u2019s religious beliefs and desire to subjugate barbarians pushed for war.\nModern illustration of what it might\u2019ve been like\nThe Shang was succeeded by the Zhou, which began as a semi-nomadic group living near the western fringe from which the original Sinids came to conquer the barbarians in the fertile Central Plains. The first King of Zhou overthrew the Shang with the help of the barbarians which suffered through the Shang\u2019s brutality, and thus began the next dynastic cycle where the Zhou brought China into the period of true feudalism, under which fiefdoms prospered eventually at the expense of the Zhou authority. As competition between the fiefdoms-turned-kingdoms (de facto) stiffen, the reality of an imminent war pushed for rapid reforms and militarization of the Chinese region, prompting many states to drive deeper into barbarian lands to obtain strategic lands and resources. The Chinese attitude of war in the Warring States period was driven by interstate rivalry and resources that would help one state best another.\nThrough reforms that brought about standardization and institutional meritocracy, the state of Qin went from humble beginnings to an industrial powerhouse whose war machine was unleashed for conquest. The scale of warfare in this period was comparable to an ancient \u201cWorld War I\u201d in which, perhaps, the German Empire emerged victorious. As each state had its reason for maintaining a strong culture of millitancy, it is much more complicated to dissect and analyze.\nFollowing unification, the Qin ramped up its national defence against the threat of a northern invasion. For centuries and millennia, the Chinese plain had been a rich and fertile oasis in the middle of less-than-desirable lands, yet with it come very little natural defence in the north. Throughout history, the Chinese people have had an overarching will to band together against this foreign threat from the north and protect the Chinese heartland. However, realizing that existing measures may not be enough to repel a large northern invasion (and rightly so in hindsight), the First Emperor looks to expand to the south of Zhongyuan to secure a Chinese \u201cLebensraum.\u201d This set off a series of invasions that ultimately led to the Chinese conquest of the south. Although the Qin forces in southern China were met with fierce resistance from the indigenous Baiyue, who repelled Chinese invasions twice, the Chinese nation at the time was arguably the more aggressive and militant of the two. With its better equipped soldiers, the Qin finally broke through the Southern Yue\u2019s last line of defence, establishing Chinese control over the region and began centuries of colonization, assimilation, and eventually acculturation.\nThe Attack of the Qin\nFrom the Qin to the Han, the recurring theme of securing the south as \u201cliving space\u201d for the Chinese and counter attacking the north to drive the barbarians away from Zhongyuan facilitated a culture of highly militant people. For a long time, the Han followed a practice where men carried sidearms upon the age of maturation, wrestling and \u201cwar games\u201d were commonplace, and the whole of Chinese society were trained to be easily conscripted or turned into militia when needed. After the rise of Han power, the Xiongnu threat had been crushed into no more than a scattered people and the Baiyue had been pacified and fell under Chinese control; from here onward began a relaxation of conscription laws and the focus was switched to developing the economy.\nThe Han strikes back!\nAs the Chinese civilization expanded, more lands were incorporated to protect the Chinese heartland. The southern expansion of the Qin, Han, and later dynasties gave the Chinese enough room and resources that the territorial shape of China Proper remained stable for the next one and a half millennia of Chinese history, thereby shifting the attention to governance, the economy and internal affairs, which not only mitigated the need for but also discouraged\u2014over time\u2014the militant culture of the Chinese because it was problematic in peacetime (as it was shown in history later again and again).\nAs to why the Chinese became rice farmers, it is because the lands in northern China weren\u2019t suited for rice farming prior to the early modern period. For the longest time, the Chinese were millet farmers until the expansion into Southern China, which allowed the Chinese settlers to cultivate rice and yield higher food production to sustain a larger population. Even today, the northern Chinese consume a lot of millet and wheat, but mostly wheat and rice.\nMillet vs rice\nActually, other than the transition from millet to wheat/rice, the Chinese also saw a change from lamb being the most consumed meat to pork now being most eaten. The change in diet occured as the population centre of the Chinese civilization shifted south, following the Uprising of the Five Barbarians, which led to various non-Sinitic people occupying the Chinese heartland in the north and expelling the Han to the south. This sparked a wave of acculturation where in the north Han and Xianbei culture intertwined and in the south Han culture intermingled with the Yue. It was during this period when most of southern China truly became sinicized (other than the Min and Yue regions, and Southwestern China). A similar wave of acculturation happened again following the collapse of the Tang dynasty, which led to Tanguts, Khitans, and Jurchens taking parts of China. After the Song dynasty fled south because of the Jurchens, the northern half of China including the Chinese heartland was occupied by the Jin dynasty and then the Mongols.

Doctors and midwives made home visits - and still do.\nHowever, my niece, whose due date is today, was planning a home birth but the midwife told them it will have to be in the Maternity hospital. No doubt it is that emergency help will be at hand If needed. EMS is overwhelmed with Coronavirus emergencies.", "The great majority of women in the UK had a home delivery by a State Certified Midwife. A doctor was only involved if a problem arose which was beyond the midwife\u2019s competence (and they could cope with most complications). There was little in the way of pain relief. Chloral hydrate and Opium drops were the most a woman could expect. Nitrous oxide and oxygen (Entonox), did not come into use until the 1950s. There was a gas called Trilene that was used from 1934, but probably not for general patients. And it had many side effects. There was then no NHS, so the midwife had to be paid for and the doctor as well, if he were called out.\nMiddle class women often gave birth in private Nursing Homes. They had the doubtful luxury of a single room but, like their poorer sisters, they did not have the comfort of their husband\u2019s presence. Men of that era would probably been unable to cope. In the nursing home, \u201c twilight sleep\u201d was administered for pain relief. This was a subcutaneous injection of Morphine and Hyoscine. If the dose needed to be repeated, the Morphine was omitted. It is not a good drug to use in obstetrics, as it depresses the baby\u2019s respiratory rate. So hyoscine was given alone. It promotes amnesia, so the mothers did not fully remember their labor pains. When all was over, husband was wheeled in to admire his new child.\nUpper-class women also often gave birth in the comfort of their own homes. But, whether nursing home or private home, a renowned Harley Street obstetrician would be involved, with probably a midwife present as well.\nBottle feeding had become fashionable among the middle classes but working class women still usually breast fed. No doubt their babies were all the better for it.\nThank you for the A2A\nMargaret Myles: A Textbook for Midwives.Livingstone (1966, Edinburgh)", "Unless you were wealthy or a high risk, the majority of births happened at home. If you couldn\u2019t afford a doctor, female relatives or a lady in the area who specialised in childbirth would deliver the baby. There was a much higher mortality rate for both mothers and infants because if there were difficulties the attending women did not have the equipment or skills required to save them. Think of all the people who need caesarean sections these days - they would often die because of blood loss, infection or ruptures.\nThe birth could happen in a house with an awful lot of other children in it, so privacy and a dedicated area for the Burt were often hard to come by. There were no drugs on offer so women could succumb to exhaustion in a long labour.\nThe advent of the NHS meant that all women had the opportunity to go to either a maternity unit or home with trained midwives and obstetricians on hand. Painkillers were available, medical interventions in case of difficulties were more possible and women could rest after childbirth without having to look after the baby and all of the other children. Childbirth became safer and mortality rates dropped. Women could still give birth at home but there would be a trained midwife there and in case of emergency, an ambulance could be summoned to take them to hospital.

Katorga, a category of punishment reserved for those convicted of the most serious crimes, had many of the features associated with labour-camp imprisonment: confinement, simplified facilities (as opposed to prisons), and forced labour, usually involving hard, unskilled or semi-skilled work. According to historian Anne Applebaum, katorga was not a common sentence; approximately 6,000 katorga convicts were serving sentences in 1906 and 28,600 in 1916.[33] Under the Imperial Russian penal system, those convicted of less serious crimes were sent to corrective prisons and also made to work.[34] Forced exile to Siberia had been in use since the seventeenth century for a wide range of offenses and was a common punishment for political dissidents and revolutionaries. In the nineteenth century, the members of the failed Decembrist revolt, Polish nobles who resisted Russian rule, and members of various socialist revolutionary groups, including Bolsheviks such as Sergo Ordzhonikidze, Leon Trotsky, and Joseph Stalin were all sent into exile.[35] Convicts serving labour sentences and exiles were sent to the underpopulated areas of Siberia and the Russian Far East \u2013 regions that had few towns or food sources and lacked any organised transportation systems. Despite the isolated conditions, there were prisoners who successfully escaped to populated areas. Stalin himself escaped three of the four times he was sent into exile.[36] From these times, Siberia gained its fearful connotation of punishment, which was further enhanced by the Soviet GULAG system. The Bolsheviks' own experiences with exile and forced labour provided them with a model on which to base their system, including the importance of strict enforcement.\n\u2026\nPenal labour\nImprisonment with hard labour was first introduced into English law with the Criminal Law Act 1776 (6 Geo III c 43),[3] also known as the \"Hulks Act\", which authorized prisoners being put to work on improving the navigation of the River Thames in lieu of transportation to the North American colonies, which had become impossible due to the American Revolutionary War.", "The first Soviet document, in which the forced labor of prisoners was considered as an economic resource, was published on April 15, 1919.

I\u2019ll lay out some foundations first and then get to that.\nMost rifles made in the 1800s were black powder. Smokeless didn\u2019t become common until the late 1800s. Black powder is inferior to smokeless for most purposes, thus most 19th century (1800s) rifles are by the use of blackpowder inferior.\nIf you mean rifles from the 1900s. Semi-autos were in common use in the early 1900s. WW I had a bushel full of them, even if the primary infantry weapon of most armies was still bolt action until the 1950s.\nAs for better. Caliber, accuracy, and reliability are the primary measures of this. There were and are junk rifles in any century.\nPurpose is another consideration. A nagant made in the 1890s has far greater range than 95% of the semi-automatics out there right now. So a single guy with a Nagant can hold off an entire squad of people using medium ranged weapons like M4s, AK-47s, just about any common configuration for the AR except for 6.5 CM. The Nagant could also take a deer at greater ranges.\nThe Nagant packs a heavier bullet and would be better at taking out big game like a bear than 95% of the semi-auto rifles out there today.\nHowever a Nagant isn\u2019t usually exceptionally accurate. Depends on when and where it was made and what modifications have been made. Semi-autos are usually fairly accurate inside 400 yards. Depends on the round. With the exception of the .50 BMG which sometimes comes as a semi-auto. Some maniac actually made a bull pup version for people who hate their shoulders lol. Generally semi-auto rounds are medium or short range calibers. I say generally. A 6.5 CM or a 30.06 semi-auto can reach out as far as a Nagant.\nBolt action rifles which were becoming very popular in the late 1800s, are typically more accurate than any other kind of rifle. In terms of velocity, a botl action and semi-auto in the same caliber, the bolt action will have more range and velocity. Usually but not necessarily better accuracy. Bolt action rifles are usually designed for accuracy first. Semi-autos favor round capacity, light weight, features, etc first. Accuracy is sometimes an after thought. However, there are some extremely accurate semi-autos and some very inaccurate bolt action rifles.\nIn a fire fight the semi-auto tends to be the better weapon. For hunting and sniping the bolt action is usually the better weapon. The long barrel on most bolt actions make them a poor choice for a self defense weapon.

To begin with Germany was going to lose money and territory by having long the war. That was a given. Germany was prepared to seize money and territory had they won the war\u2014they did so against France in 1871, and against Romania and Russia in 1918. They had also planned to annex large parts of France and Belgium had they won. Germany mostly lost areas that had traditionally been parts of other nations (A-L to France, S-H to Denmark) who had area with large non-German populations for example to Poland. (And no, the Sudetenland does not count as that had been part of AUSTRIA not Germany).\nReoperations? Not nearly as crushing, especially since the allies were willing to negotiate and set up payment plans. And again, Germany had demanded on \u201cindemnities\u201d from France twice in the 1800s (though once as the German Confederation of the Rhine) and like I pointed out, from Russia in 1918.

It looks very much as though it comes from an older sense of the verb meaning to boil gently, to parboil.

Hence, by association of ideas, coddle took on its modern sense.\u201d\n\u201cThe first bit is on the face of it easy enough, since it is from the pet form of the given name Mary (as in Sweet Molly Malone of Dublin\u2019s fair city). But Molly has also had a long history in several different but related senses associated with low living. (The name was popularised by Middleton and Dekker\u2019s play The Roaring Girl of 1611, which featured a criminal called Moll Cut-purse.) As either molly or moll, from the early seventeenth century on it was often used to describe a prostitute, hence, much later, the American gangster\u2019s moll. As molly it was also a common eighteenth-century name for a homosexual man, often in the form Miss Molly, and a molly housewas a male brothel (as in Mark Ravenhill\u2019s new play at the National Theatre in London, Mother Clap\u2019s Molly House).\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s sometimes said that the molly in mollycoddlecomes from the sense of a prostitute, but the usage evidence shows that it was really linked to the gay associations. As a noun, it was used particularly of a man who had been over-protected in childhood and so considered to have been made into a milksop or effeminate. For example, William Makepeace Thackeray wrote in Pendennis in 1849: \u201cYou have been bred up as a molly-coddle, Pen, and spoilt by the women\u201d.

It appears that Tibetans captured a number of Arab troops and pressed them into service on the eastern frontier in 801. Tibetans were active as far west as Samarkand\nand Kabul\n. Arab forces began to gain the upper hand, and the Tibetan governor of Kabul submitted to the Arabs and became a Muslim about 812 or 815.\nThe first contacts with Tibet and the Islamic world began around the mid-eighth century when it grew out of a combination of trade via the Silk Road\nand the military presence of Muslim forces in the Fergana Valley\n. Despite the vague knowledge the Islamic world had about Tibet, there were a few early Islamic works that mention Tibet. One such source is from a work authored by Abu Sa'id Gardezi\ntitled Zayn al-Akhbar. In it, the work mentions the environment, fantastical origin of the Tibetans (through the Himyarites), the divinity of the king, major resources (like musk) and a description of the trade routes to and from Tibet. Another source, Hudud al-'Alam (The Regions of the World) written by an unknown author in 982 or 983 in Afghanistan\n, contains mainly geography, politics and brief descriptions of Tibetan regions, cities, towns and other localities. This source has the first direct mention of the presence of Muslims in Tibet by stating that Lhasa\nhad one mosque and a small Muslim population.\nExtensive trade with Kashmir\n, Ladakh\n, and Baltistan\nalso brought Muslims to Tibet especially after the adoption or growing presence of Islam in these regions starting from the fourteenth century. The ongoing growth of Muslims continued as an affect of the Tibetan-Ladakhi treaty of 1684 in which the Tibetan government allowed trade missions from Ladakh to enter Lhasa every three years. Many Kashmiri and Ladakhi Muslims joined these missions with some settling in Tibet.\nDuring the reign of the Dalai Lama Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso\n(1617-1682), a permanent Muslim community settled down in Tibet. They were permitted to elect their own council of representatives, settle their group's legal disputes with Islamic law, and some land was donated to them for the construction of a mosque close to Lhasa\n.\nAn influx of Kashmiri Muslims in Nepal (originally having trade contacts with their kin in Tibet) fled to Tibet starting from 1769 as a consequence of the invasion of the Kathmandu Valley\nby Prithvi Narayan Shah\n. As early as the seventeenth century, Ningxia\nand other northwestern Hui\n(Chinese Muslims) began to settle in the eastern regions of Tibet (like in Amdo\n). They intermarried with the local Tibetans and continued to have to extensive trade contacts with other Muslims inside China.\nAnother recent wave of new Muslim settlers began after the Dogra conquest of Tibet in 1841. Many Kashmiri and Ladakhi Muslim troops (who were taken as prisoners when fighting against the Dogra army) stayed behind to settle in Tibet. A few Hindu Dogras also settled in Tibet and subsequently converted to Islam.\nAfter the Chinese conquest of Tibet in 1950, the Tibetan Muslims faced brutal persecution just like their Buddhist brethren. Since then, Chinese Muslims (along with the Han and others) have settled in Tibet.\nThe Chinese government classified the Tibetan Muslims as Hui. However, the Tibetan Muslims are often called Zang Hui (Tibetan Hui) as they speak Tibetan and have a material culture almost identical to their Buddhist counterparts. The Tibetan Hui in Lhasa\n(unlike other Tibetan Muslims living elsewhere) consider themselves to be very different from the Chinese Muslims and sometimes marry with other Tibetans (including Buddhist) instead of their fellow Muslims from China.\nConverts in Qinghai\nIslam was spread by the Salar people\nto the formerly Buddhist Kargan Tibetans in Lamo-shan-ken.\nSome Tibetans in Qinghai who converted to Islam are now considered Hui people\n.\nBalti people\nThe Balti people\nof Baltistan\nin Pakistan\nand Kargil\nin India\nare descendants of Tibetan Buddhists who converted to Noorbakshia\nsect of Islam . With the passage of time a large number converted to Shia Islam\n, and a few converted to Sunni\nIslam. Their Balti language\nis highly archaic and conservative and closer to Classical Tibetan\nthan other Tibetan languages\n.\nlinks\nISLAM & TIBET Bibliography\nHistory of the Muslims of Tibet\nForeign relations of Tibet - Wikipedia\nTibetan Muslims - Wikipedia", "If Arabs tried to conquer Tibet, then naturally Tibetans would seek Chinese help.\nAnd that would give Chinese another chance to drive out Arabs from Central Asia.\nSo it is logical that Arabs chose not to break their friendship with Tibet."], "topic_list": ["Tibet", "Invasions", "Historic Battles", "The Arab World", "Arab Ethnicity and People", "The Middle East", "Islam", "Military History and Wars", "China", "International Relations", "History"], "view_list": [23, 46], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Aakash Paran Baishya", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "question_title": "After the Battle of Talas in 751 A.D, why did Arabs not invaded Tibet?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "159", "name_list": ["Aakash Paran Baishya", "Sagar Meloth"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020"]}, "875": {"ans_list": ["Who is the author?

Patton never experienced such difficulties.\nI love the German saying if the plane is green it\u2019s British, if it\u2019s silver it\u2019s American and if it\u2019s invisible it\u2019s the Luftwaffe \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude37.\nBig difference in the game for both generals.", "I would have to say Guderian by a country mile and then some. Guderian was calm and collected who used aggression in a controlled manner to punch through his enemy and wreak havoc in his rear. He may not have been as brilliant or original as Manstein but in strategic decisions they were in accord. He may have been caustic and difficult with his superiors but he was usually proven to be right. He also instinctively knew how to get the best out of his men and their armour which may sound a rather simple thing but is very difficult to achieve. He understood logistics and how his army could operate within and on the boundaries of those constraints. He won crushing victories in both the east and the west and was seen as a true threat by all his enemies for his cunning and doggedness.\nPatton on the other hand blew hot and cold and was often ruled by his emotions. He was undoubtedly a good general but he was never as consistent or as effective as Guderian and this comes down to logistics. Patton was useless at logistics and as a result on many occasions his army was hamstrung by his inattentive nature to the minutiae of logistical planning which would have allowed him to exploit victory or stave off defeat, especially in Tunisia. He was definitely very aggressive but it often took the form of gambles rather than calculated risks. Of all the western generals he is the only one where his detractors called him a callous butcher. For him the offensive was all and only the willingness to fight and die mattered. Great when he picks the right plan but disastrous when he picks the wrong one which he did on occasion. Unlike Guderian he often swung from brilliance to mediocrity. Having lunched a successful operation to take Sicily he then hits two ill or worn out men and is relieved of duty. Guderian never did that from what I have seen. Operationally he would also blow hot and cold. Launching a successful breakout in France only to run out of fuel and hit the meat grinder at Metz. Patton was respected as a competent battle commander, which he undoubtedly was, but compared to Guderian he was an overactive spaniel. Very good at what it does but if it behaved on the leash would be a better all rounder.

Wessex was the last of the large kingdoms to form, and up to about 685 the situation there is pretty fluid and obscure, but certainly strong Mercian kings like Penda (r.626\u2013655) or Wulfhere (r.658\u2013675) campained and intervened in the region that would become Wessex. Also, in 664, Wulfhere intervened in Essex to overthrow its last pagan king. Sussex, on the other hand, tended to be a willing ally of Mercia at that time. It made strategic sense, in that the rulers of Sussex correctly saw that the main threat they faced was a strong, unified Wessex. Perhaps because of this, King C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex concentrated on defeating and occupying Sussex, succeeding by 688.\nBy the century\u2019s end, Mercia was clearly the largest and most vigorous of the kingdoms, but Wessex was still a power in its own right, fully able to maintain its independence until 726. At that point there was a succession dispute. Exactly what happened is obscure, but one interpretation is that Mercia intervened to put its candidate, \u00c6thelheard, on the throne, and Wessex \u2018submitted\u2019 to Mercia.\n\u2018Ascendancy\u2019 was a peculiarly British form of relationship between kings or kingdoms. One king would \u2018submit\u2019 to another, but still remain in power otherwise, and when the ascendant kingdom weakened, it often happened that the submitting king would then reassert his full independence.\nIn 752, King Cuthred of Wessex threw off Mercian overlordship. In 757, Mercia manged to get its chosen candidate, Cynewulf, onto the throne of Wessex, but then fell into a succession crisis itself, giving Cynewulf the chance to assert his independence as described above, which he maintained for the rest of his reign, until 786.\nAt that point, Offa of Mercia was able to get his ally, Beorhtric, onto the throne of Wessex and establish a full client relationship again. This lasted until 802, when Ecgberht, who had been Beorhtric\u2019s main rival in 786, at last took the throne. He pursued a more independent policy from the start, and in 825 managed to turn the tables, defeating Beornwulf of Mercia and taking control of Mercia\u2019s small dependencies, including Essex and Sussex. In 829, he consolidated this by invading Mercia and making himself king there too. Mercia reasserted its independence the following year, but its ascendancy was over.\nSo I think we can say the Mercian ascendancy began by 700, and included overlordship of Essex as early as 664, but with overlordship of (almost certainly) all the Saxon kingdoms only between 726\u2013752 and 786\u2013825.", "King Offa of Mercia, ruled the South ofEngland, (South of the Humber), I believe Wessex was more of a vassal Kingdom at the time, rather than part of Mercia itself.\nThis was pretty much over all Saxons, since those in the North (Kingdom of Northumbria) were Angles.\nOffa was King of Mercia from 757\u2013796, during a period know was the Mercian Supremacy.\nThe Mercian Supremacy ended in 825, when King Ecgbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf of Mercia, establishing independence for Wessex.

Since they started with a civil war, they were quite experienced in executing people way before USSR was formed, so they had some ideas. First, it was (almost always) done via shooting. Like, hanging is more about killing people, while shooting is about FIGHTING THE ENEMY. The fact that that said enemy was defenceless didn\u2019t really matter - there always was an assumption that \u2018he would kill you if he had a chance\u2019, just because he is THE ENEMY.\nSo in Stalin\u2019s time firing squads were used, which served the purpose of revealing \u2018personal guilt\u2019 - if four people shoot at the same time, it\u2019s not like \u2018I did it\u2019, it\u2019s more like \u2018we\u2019 or even \u2018they\u2019, if your mind can do tricks.

Since conviction they were under some special restrictions, one of those was - they always traveled between the chambers at the facility with a bag on their heads, to avoid possible escaping attempts. Since it was moths or years between the conviction and actual executing, they got quite used to the drill of walking with 2 guards, holding them from each side, with a bag on their head. Thus at a date X the executioner came from behind, and made exactly 1 shoot directly at the 3d vertebra (that one is easy to locate, it forms a visible bump just between your neck and your back). The result was an instant death from spinal shock, and the victim was dead long before his body hanged in guard\u2019s hands.\nThe executioner was normally just an officer who had stone nerves and was able to return to his normal duties the very next day.

International politics dictates no one is truly your enemy forever,and neither are they your eterbal ally.\nYou ally with those you share a common cause with, and oppose those who are your obstacles. Vietnam and the US were enemies in the Vietnam War but since then there's been little reason for the two to continue their fight when they have a common foe in China.\nThink of Britain and France, rivals and enemies for most of the last millennium but had to team up when Germany threatened both of their positions on the global stage. The US and Russia,once allies in WW2 turned out to be another marriage of convenience to fight Nazi Germany. Once Hitler had blown his brains out and WW2 had ended,it was Capitalism Vs Communism with the US on one side and USSR on the other.\nThere are more knowledgeable people than me in this subject who can give a more in-depth answer but you get the idea of why it looks like one time enemies the US and Vietnam are growing closer together.", "Ho Chi Minh erroneously believed that the US would side with Vietnam seeking to free itself from French colonial rule and was a big fan of the American constitution and declaration of independence.\nOnly when the French and the Americans tried to bomb Vietnam back to the stone age did the Vietnamese decided to lash back and get these colonialists out of their country.\nIn 1951, Italy, France, West Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg decided to form a union - a mere 6 years after the end of WW2 where 2 guys were on one side and 4 on the other. Since then, more countries on either side of the iron curtain have joined the union and one has joined and then left (after threatening to leave for 3+ years).\nCzechs and Slovaks wanted to split up their country but both were equally keen to join EU. Made me shake my head.\nIndia has an odd relationship with US - part revulsion, part attraction.", "Many countries that were enemies in one war were allies in another. That's not ironic, it's normal.\nEngland and France were enemies for centuries, then became allies. Countries tend not to have permanent friends or permanent enemies.", "History has plenty of ironic former blood feud enemies-turned-alliances, so Vietnam become a close ally to the US isn\u2019t something so surprising.\nLook at Western Europe, nations were pretty much constantly at war trying to wipe each others out for the last 500 years, now turned into one of the most geopolitically stable regions on Earth, where anyone can cross borders as easily as shopping groceries downtown.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe a war of apocalyptic scale just took place as recently as 75 years ago on this land. Thanks to the EU, the region has achieved the level of unprecedented peace and prosperity unheard of since maybe the time of the Roman Empire.\nOr how can we not mention the relationship between the US and the UK. From enemies in the American Revolutionary War to become strategic allies in modern time.\nFrom this\nto this\ndrastic improvement if you ask me.\nOr how about the relationship between the US and Japan. Both armies grinded each others out in some of the bloodiest displays of fanaticism and atrocity during the Pacific Campaign of World War II. Asking a soldier or a citizen from both sides in 1945 if they would think that one day, their nations will become friends and allies, have joint military exercises, trade partnerships, and enjoy each others culture, i'm quite sure their answer will be: unlikely.\nAnd yet, the unlikely happened.\nThese are just three of the most prominent examples of the more recent times. We can talk about countless other ironic turns of alliances that goes back to Bronze Age, but that will require word count comparable to an encyclopedia. What my point is, geopolitic situations change all the time, and no affiliation or animosity are set on stone. There're just nations with different interests. When interests converge, alliances are formed. Or the opposite. The Vietnam War was no doubt one of the most terrible conflicts of the last century, but it does not mean there's little chance for a strategic relationship between Vietnam and the US to be formed. As long as they have the same interests, stand on the same ground, and have the same adversary, the possibility of the US gaining another close ally in the South East Asia is becoming more of a reality.", "There is no real irony in this. The United States, in its history, has also been at war with the United Kingdom (twice), France, Mexico, Spain, Germany (twice), Austria, Hungary, Japan and Italy, among other countries. It has friendly relations with, and an alliance, with every one of those nations today. There is nothing ironic about former enemies making common cause at a later date.\nThat Vietnam might become a US ally (and it de facto already is) is no more out of the ordinary than this. Countries form alliances based on what makes sense at a given time. In the case of Vietnam, it never wanted to be an enemy of the United States in the first place; that was a choice we made, by intervening in a civil war in that country on the side of the non-Communist faction. In fact, Vietnam, throughout its long history as a nation, has never desired anything but friendly relations with other countries. They simply want their own sovereignty respected.\nAt the present time, they (correctly) perceive China as a danger to their sovereignty, while the United States no longer has any interest in the internal affairs of Vietnam and sees that country as a trading partner and possible ally in what is now the most important part of the world, the Pacific Rim. Therefore, the geopolitical interests of both the USA and Vietnam, which were at odds with each other in the mid-20th century, now coincide.\nVietnam is an old and proud Nation which extends one hand to the world in friendship, but keeps its other hand on its dagger, lest it is attacked.

By 1917 or so it wasn\u2019t possible to identify purely British war aims, which had become subsumed into consolidated Imperial war aims\nThe aims of Britain\u2019s allies had to be taken into account, though Britain wouldn\u2019t have fought another day for Alsace-Lorraine or for Italian control of Trieste.\nWith the exit of Russia and the entry of the USA into the war, ideological war aims became more prominent. and it became possible to represent the war as a conflict between democracies and absolutist states.\nThere were other conditional \u201cnice to have if available\u201d war aims, such was the destruction of the German High Seas Fleet, but that was never a primary British war aim.\nProf Millman\u2019s article in 1914\u201318 encyclopaedia is very good.\nWar Aims and War Aims Discussions (Great Britain and Ireland)"], "topic_list": ["Government of the United Kingdom", "World Wars", "World War I", "History of Great Britain", "World War II", "World History", "Warfare", "The United Kingdom", "Military History and Wars", "History"], "view_list": [44], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Oscar Mayorga", "upvote_list": [0], "question_title": "What were the UK government's goals in the beginning of World War 1, and did they change by the end of the war?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "605", "name_list": ["Mark Baker"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020"]}, "459": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Introductory Texts", "Industrial Engineering", "History"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Mansi Jena", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What is the introductory history of Yokota Industrial tools?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "51", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "753": {"ans_list": ["Ferdinand III.", "Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III:\nThe Peace of Westphalia (German: Westf\u00e4lischer Friede) was a series of peace treaties signed between May and October 1648 in the Westphalian cities of Osnabr\u00fcck and M\u00fcnster, effectively ending the European wars of religion. These treaties ended the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) in the Holy Roman Empire, between the Habsburgs and their Catholic allies and the Protestant (Sweden, Denmark, Dutch, Holy Roman Principalities) and Catholic (France) Anti-Habsburg allies; and the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648) between Spain and the Dutch Republic, with Spain formally recognising the independence of the Dutch Republic.\nThe peace negotiations involved a total of 109 delegations representing European powers, including Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III, Philip IV of Spain, the Kingdom of France, Cristina of the Swedish Empire, the Dutch Republic, the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire, and sovereigns of the free imperial cities.

The treaties did not restore peace throughout Europe, but they did create a basis for national self-determination.\nThe Peace of Westphalia established the precedent of peaces established by diplomatic congress,[4][5] and a new system of political order in central Europe, later called Westphalian sovereignty, based upon the concept of co-existing sovereign states. Inter-state aggression was to be held in check by a balance of power. A norm was established against interference in another state's domestic affairs. As European influence spread across the globe, these Westphalian principles, especially the concept of sovereign states, became central to international law and to the prevailing world order.[6]"], "topic_list": ["Thirty Years' War", "Holy Roman Empire", "Roman Emperors", "Historical Germany", "History of Europe", "Roman Empire", "World History", "Germany", "Military History and Wars", "History"], "view_list": [6, 17], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Blake Winfield", "upvote_list": [0, 2], "question_title": "Which Holy Roman Emperor signed the Peace of Westphalia that ended the Thirty Years\u2019 War (1618-1648)?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "621", "name_list": ["Bernd Geischer", "Anonymous"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020"]}, "737": {"ans_list": ["No crowned monarch in British history has after they have been anointed ever abdicated.

Chief Supreme Court Justice Warren would write in his memoirs on page 367:\n\"Practically all the Cabinet members of President Kennedy's administration, along with Director J.

He was openly critical that the Warren Commission could only rely on the FBI\u2019s investigation. Boggs was quoted as saying, \"Hoover lied his eyes out to the Commission - on Oswald, on Ruby, on their friends, the bullets, the guns, you name it...\" Asked about the single bullet theory after the WCR came out, Boggs commented, \u201cI had strong doubts about it.\u201d On April 1, 1971 Boggs would deliver a blistering attack on Hoover saying the FBI under his directship had assumed \u201cthe tactics of the Soviet Union and the German Gestapo.\u201d\nHale Boggs would die in a plane crash in 1972 in Alaska, the wreckage never found.

I could not agree with this statement.\"\nGeorgia US Senator Richard Russell, and former Warren Commissioner:\n\"We have not been told the truth about Oswald.\"\nWith the WCR ready to go to the printer, Russell wanted to delay over the issue of the Single Bullet Theory. At a Sept. 18, 1964 meeting with LBJ, the Senator expressedhis doubts. \u201cThey were trying to prove that the same bullet that hit Kennedy first was the one that hit Connally, went through him and through his hand, his bone, into his leg and everything else. \u2026 The commission believes that the same bullet that hit Kennedy hit Connally.

Beyond any rational question the USA made very serous peace offers to the USSR to try to avert hostilities. These were rebuffed \u2014 for no legitimate reason.\nAlfred Montestruc's answer to How did the Cold War start? What did the Soviets do, and what did the US do?", "Ideological differences played an important but not exclusive role. Given that neither the US nor Britain understood World War II\u2019s devastating impact on the Soviet Union, its people, and its government, they would have feared the Soviet advance into Central Europe even without any ideological differences. The Soviet-backed coup in Czechoslovakia increased their fears. That coup had both ideological and power politics components. Any Soviet or Russian government of any ideology coming out of a devastating war like World War II would have demanded and obtained a sphere of influence with high domination over Eastern and Central European areas likely to serve as staging areas for another attack and another war. The US and Britain could have opposed this domination on national interest grounds. But these grounds would not have persuasive to their peoples. Most Americans care little or nothing about Eastern and even Central Europe. Most Britons cared something about these areas, but the war had been devastating to them, too. Neither Americans nor Britons were looking for another war. But the British and American political and economic elites concluded that only an ideological threat could convince Americans and Britons to accept another conflict so soon after World War II. These elites felt the Soviet threat themselves far more than their peoples. These elites felt the Communist ideological threat far more than their peoples. So, in launching the Cold War and keeping it going, ideology was crucial. At first, this use of ideology was successful. But in the 1960s, it no longer worked.\nA similar analysis applies to the Soviet Union and its people. The Soviet people were not interested in another conflict so soon after devastating World War II. Power politics alone would never persuade them to support another conflict. Power politics alone would persuade them to tolerate it like they tolerated everything else about the Soviet dictatorship. So, to generate popular enthusiasm for the Cold War, the Soviet regime had to use both Communist ideology and conversion of Britain and America from allies to threats. At first, this use of ideology was successful. But in the 1960s, it no longer worked.\nIn the 1960s, a new generation (mine) began coming of age. The old ideological conflicts and old national power rivalries moved us much less. The counterculture, the Beetles, and peace moved us much more. On both sides of the Iron Curtain, that was true.\nHoward Lederman", "I disagree. Both were Capitalist states creating sphere\u2019s of influence.

The problem was the USA went red baiting at home and also had to be seen doing abroad.", "US confrontation of the Soviet Union and Russia under Putin in the 21st Century was largely reactive. In both cases US policy followed actively hostile confrontational policies by the Soviets or Russia. There\u2019s little reason to think the US would have confronted the Soviet Union over Socialism per se if it wasn\u2019t ideologically dedicated to overthrowing Liberal Democracy in the West and being militarily hostile.\nThe relationship with the Soviet Union was doomed by starting with military intervention against the Bolsheviks which was driven more by their opposition to Russia being allied with the West in WW1 than ideology. The US did provide substantial civilian aid to Russia in the 1920\u2019s, a huge effort lead by future President Herbert Hoover.\nSimilarly the US was politically supportive of Russia (though probably not aggressively enough) after the fall of the Soviet Union in the period when it didn\u2019t have policies directly hostile to the US and seemed to be trying to reform.\nThe US in the absence of active threats from it would basically ignore Russia, which seems to be part of the problem.", "Ideological differences seem to have played virtually no role in the existence of the conflict.\nIdeology was certainly used as a reason why people should support one side or the other.\nBut that\u2019s not the same thing as the conflict existing because of the ideological differences.\nDuring the Cold War, states like China or Yugoslavia, who were ostensibly ideologically on roughly the same side as the USSR, but weren\u2019t puppets of the USSR, were just as likely to support the US at any given moment.\nYes, they had lengthy explanations of how this was all due to their being true Marxists and the USSR revisionists\u2014but it\u2019s fairly clear that these were justifications after the fact, not reasons for the action.\nRussia seems to have picked up more or less where the Soviet Union left off in terms of its foreign policy, and indeed seems to consciously acknowledge this, presenting Stalin (for example) as a hero of Russian nationalism\u2014which is actually probably more accurate than how he was presented at the time.", "Ideological rivalry was no more than a pretext.

Your description of Kierkegaard\u2019s thought is the antithesis to \u201cleveling\u201d which is what you are looking to understand. Put simply, this area of thought (which may be too generous) is recognized by modern philosophers to be the acid which destroys and accelerates the destruction of culture and elevates materialism which eviscerates the value of Man.\nTo provide a simple and well-known example, George Orwell described the man of the future as devoid of any unique aspects which make us human, namely, subjectivity. The dictatorial political system seeks to level everyone. No one has more, no one reads books, no one goes to places alone, etc. And, the thought police who would arrest people for having private thoughts and the massive television in every home that could not only transmit the constant oratory of the Leader but allowed the Government to constantly watch its citizens.) The fear of having individual thought which provides us with our goals of self-knowledge also allows man to exercise free thought. There is a great danger here, in my opinion, since the naming of ever more narrow areas of thought (and Science) is not only obfuscating and confusing but seems to be a way for certain unexceptional thinkers to stamp their thought with an imprimatur of validity. Thus, we know more and more about less and less. One should remember that the thought of the greatest philosophers never fit into a little box with a bow\u2014\nI am not seeking praise or arrogantly attempting to secure adulation but only to distinguish myself enough to support the comments I made above regarding philosophers who concern themselves with \u201cleveling\u201d (unless of course the study of leveling is done to criticize and undermine its validity). I believe that to give some substance for my sharp opinions about this issue, (which I do not enjoy criticizing) I may permissibly refer to my educational background (which in any case is easily found linked to my name and on my home page). I hold (1) a Philosophy Degree in Modern Philosophy, granted with honors based on my thesis on the modern misunderstanding of Nietzsche; (2) a Masters Degree in Modern European Philosophy, focused on the Modern philosophers who inherited the world foreseen and predicted by Nietzsche, and who all attempted to respond to the problems, issues and catastrophe recognized by Nietzsche, and all of whom failed in their own way; (3) during my Masters study in Modern European Philosophy, I went to and graduated from Law School; (4) studied Ancient Philosophy including the pre-Socratics, Plato and Aristotle, in Ancient Greek for two years; (5) was a Masters assistant to the Chairman of the Philosophy department at University; and (6) studied at Harvard and Columbia University concerning the source and analysis of the modern influence of pragmatism, materialism and science on man\u2019s sense of despair. Based on this, and recognizing that piling up degrees is no substitute for intuition or wisdom, I believe that I can assay that Kierkegaard\u2019s thought was written in repudiation of \u201cmass man,\u201d he was the philosopher who stated that a mob is the definition of untruth. Thus, I believe that the issue you raise of \u201cleveling,\u201d which has been a constant destruction of the value of a public or even college education for 50 years, since this leveling reduces the level of education to the lowest common denominator, lowering the level of dialogue and study of all thought to the most uneducated, as an example, is emphatically opposed to the highly destructive and irrelevant type of thought embodied in the study of this theme.\nIn \u201cLeveling down,\u201d as some describe materialism or the destruction of man, and with the caveat that this appellation is unknown to me and I do not know any modern or any other philosopher who adopted this concept as something valuable, I will simply say that my understanding of it, and by answering this question, which I originally thought not important enough to answer, I do not wish to lend to this \u201cPhilosophy\u201d if philosophy it is, is the destruction or exclusion of unique man from a philosophy of man, the eradication of the individual, the unique, and the subjective nature of man. Man is obscured if we view man from this perspective, and man is considered to be the eradication or all distinctions except those aspects of the mob which characterize mass man, unintelligibility, a world in which all distinctions between the unique and the general, the superior and the average, the important and the trivial have been eroded.\nKierkegaard asserted that existence is a category which is only relevant to the free individual. Realizing oneself is only possible by realizing oneself through free choice between meaningful choices, and achieving self-commitment.\nTo exist therefore, according to Kierkegaard, means becoming and distinguishing oneself insofar as he is unique\u2014because the only real man is unique and he is less and less a member of a group."], "topic_list": ["S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (philosopher, author)", "Epistemology", "Philosophy of Mind", "Metaphysics", "Philosophers", "Concepts", "The Mind", "Philosophy", "History"], "view_list": [42], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Dex Jackson", "upvote_list": [0], "question_title": "Are there any predecessors to the leveling concept of Kierkegaard (metaphysics, philosophy of mind, history of philosophy, philosophy)?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "158", "name_list": ["David H.

The CIA\u2019s intervention in Vietnam escalated into the Vietnam War which greatly escalated the drug trafficking and profit for this portion of the CIA operation.\u201d\nCIA didn\u2019t care about innocent lives.

One was subliminal. I believe we were there, because of a deep conviction in our very bones that the white man should rule all non white races. Secondly, we were fighting for the supremacy of Plutocracy. Our hostility towards Communism wasn\u2019t because they were lacking in the Human Rights department. Our hostility toward Communism was because it scared the living shit out of the West\u2019s \u2018elites.\u2019\nI thought this \u2018White Man\u2019s Burden\u2019 shit had died with Vietnam. These days, I\u2019m not so sure. Just about everything I used to believe regarding moral progress in our civilization has been rocked by the resurgence of Fascism throughout the world.

Ho Chi Minh was a close ally of the US fighting the Japanese. When Japan was defeated, Ho-Chi-Minh was no more needed. He was discarded. France wanted her colony back and was white. So the US turned around to support, finance and than do it by herself to fight her own ally Ho Chi Minh. You see the connection? Vietnamese and Japanese were not white. So it was not a big deal to support Ho-Chi-Minh- to fight the Japanese. But when it was done , the white supremacy should be back and the US was more than willing to pay for it. What a big shame! To think about it.", "You know the US is the only super power country standing for human rights and freedoms world and they stand up for protect the ideology of capitalism and humanity and increasing the human standards of living. The mission was from the Americans ancestors and god vision for Americans to make the world with the same standards of livings like the US which we can call it the heaven on earth god given to us the Americans people.\nThat why you see the Americans Careed out gods vision with their own money and the blood of their soldiers around the world they are not like the French and England or Soviet and China", "The US invaded Vietnam to contain Soviet and Chinese influence, simply put. The US would then use the pretext of trying to \u2018preserve democracy\u2019 and \u2018fight communism\u2019 but nowadays we know that this is fake news and that each country can thrive under its own political culture. Vietnam was just a proxy war between the US and those that threatened US global hegemony. There is no point in trying to hide the fact or sugarcoat it with flowery ideological propaganda.\nFor the broader context, it is WW2. The US just defeated Japan and then began occupying Japan\u2019s former colony Korea. China (and Russia), not wanting the US to invade further into Northeast Asia or Siberia, fought back the US troops in the Korean war, ultimately resulting in a stalemate and the bipartition of Korea by 1953.\nYou are the US. You are the first and only nation so far to have detonated two atomic bombs in real war. You supposedly have the strongest military in the world. And you just got pushed back by the Soviets and PRC. You do have the option of letting it go, but the US did not and persisted. They tried to set up their own sphere of influence in East Asia, including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan; ultimately all in an effort to counter Russia and China.\nSo why invade Vietnam? After Japan lost, Vietnam declared independence from France (who colonized it under French Indochina). China supported the Vietnamese independence against the French, who in turn was backed by the US and allies. By 1954, the French gave up and Vietnam was divided between North and South similarly to Korea.\nHowever the whole point is that Vietnam was not and did not end up like Korea. In 1955, Ho Chi Minh organized the Viet Cong campaign to unify North and South under a communist regime. This was two years after the end of the Korean War in 1953, and the US was still bitter about that stalemate. They saw Minh\u2019s campaign as an expansion of the Soviet sphere of influence and sought to contain it, resulting in the Vietnam war, with Minh backed by the Soviets and PRC against the US. After years of pointless fighting, the US gave up; and when the NY Times report was released to the public, the American conscious was furious.\nYou might think the whole Cold War was about democracy and capitalism vs. communism. But fundamentally, it was about limiting the spread of the USSR, which back then was the main rival of the US empire.\nThe US victory after WW2 ushered in a new world order where the US became one of the superpowers of the world. Since Soviet collapse in the 90s, for a few decades one could argue that the US was the sole superpower; and to maintain its privileged position as number one, the US had to find all sorts of mechanisms and pretexts to prevent the rise of other nations above themselves\u2014because America is \u2018oh so special\u2019 and \u2018exceptional\u2019.\nIn the 90s Japan threatened to overtake the US economy, so the US instituted the Plaza Accord and blamed Toshiba for selling stuff to the Soviets. The US used the pretexts of \u2018security threats\u2019 among other things to put Japan down. And Japan, lacking their own military and relying on US military support, lacked options and sovereignty on this issue.\nThe recent trade war against China\u2014to put it bluntly\u2014is just another US effort to contain an up and coming competitor. China has 5G, whereas most of the US does not. Here China is actually out-innovating and out-competing US tech. But the US likes being number one and will try to pull all sorts of levers to make sure everybody else is inferior and reliant on the US: say Huawei is a security threat and cripple their supply base; raise tariffs to coerce and bully China into instituting humiliating and unequal treaties.\nIf you are another nation who idiotically thinks they can benefit from undermining China, just note that the US would never elevate you above themselves, and as soon as you begin to challenge their hegemony, they will make every effort to put you down as well, as they did with Japan, the USSR, as they are doing with China.\nWake up, this is called imperialism, and with a country as big as China, already so integrated in the world economy, and with their own military, political sovereignty, and the strength of their own cultural and historical ethos, these old gimmicks will not work anymore.\nMany people already see right through the US\u2019s tricks and are tired of its games, from New Zealand, the Middle East, Africa, and even Europe. The current administration\u2019s immature and reckless actions are already signalling the beginning of the end of American exceptionalism. The US\u2019s vain attempts to resist the a new multipolar world order are just going to come back and haunt US. It is foolish to fight the inevitable; just accept the dawn of a new era.\nNowadays we know that the US badly failed in Vietnam and kept the war secret until the New York Times leaked a Pentagon report. Even the most patriotic of nationalists who blindly trust their government have to admit that Vietnam was one of the biggest blunders of the past century by US, wasting our money, the lives of our citizens, and done all behind our backs.\nThis is not anti-American. This is just the brutal reality. Do you see the NYTimes as \u2018anti-American\u2019? What about Ed Snowden? Or what about the millions of Americans who oppose our current administrations\u2019 policies?\nAnd do you trust a president who molests women, colludes with Russia, hides his tax returns, says his nuclear button is bigger than North Korea\u2019s, threatens to annihilate Iran, ditches climate issues, labels Latin American and African immigrants as \u201cs***holes\u201d?\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/americas/2018/12/10-trump-administration-2018-missed-181226191428885.html\nSuch a role model the US administration has become. Just remember all those protests of the 60s, the musicians like Bob Dylan writing songs against US involvement in the Vietnam War, all those hippie vibes about love and peace in a world undivided. So let\u2019s count on ourselves, the American people to see when our government is trying to deceive us. The world can use a lot more love and mutual cooperation, unhampered by the dirty world of politics, especially US politics.", "I would like to suggest listening to William Cooper\u2019s 3 hr presentation in Arizona for the real reason for the war.

In the late 50\u2019s and early 60\u2019s this was a real fear, held by many, imagining another Korea-like event, but gaining momentum enough to become unstoppable.\nAs you can see, from a chart[1] Vietnam ranks 25th in oil reserves, having less than 3% of the world\u2019s #2 supplier, and further in the graph in the article, about 14% of the American reserves, and Vietnam also lacks the production facilities, so the idea that the US would go to war for such a small reserve, with an Ally in Canada to the north, who would happily sell oil at a fraction of the cost it would take to obtain it militarily halfway around the globe, as in answer suggests, is preposterous to the point of being laughable.\nProxy wars, communist revolutions were real and common at the time.

Vietnam trended to be a sub super power as well as USSR\u2019s proxy in south-east Asia at that time. That is a bad news to China that viewed USSR as her arch enemy in the Cold War, worrying threatened from both sides. So Deng, who is China\u2019 most powerful man, decided to go to war against Vietnam employing 1/20 of millitary forces (most of PLA forces were placed along North border for possible USSR interference), before Vietnam became a powerful dangerous proxy of USSR. On the other hand, the USSR had to mobilize half of its forces to launch a similar limited war against China. Actually, the USSR did nothing more than denouncing during the short-time Sino-Vietnam war and chronic border conflicts. Vietnam was greatly weakened and USSR was humiliated, while China and the West enterred a 10-year honey moon.", "I used to teach entire college courses on this, so the answer isn\u2019t simple. What\u2019s important is to realize that there was never a single decision to \u201cgo to war in Vietnam.\u201d Instead, there was a long series of incremental decisions, from the 1940s to the 1960s (even the 1970s) by a series of US administrations, Democratic as well as Republican, each of them building on the decisions already made and the situation we therefore found ourselves in. At almost every stage, people could look back and say, \u201cAw, if we\u2019d done this instead of that a decade ago, we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess, but since we\u2019re here, let\u2019s try to make the best of it . . .\u201d and would then head off into another bad decision.\nAt some point in my course I would usually lead the class in a song (literally) that goes, to the tune of Auld Lang Syne: \u201cWe\u2019re here because we\u2019re here because we\u2019re here because we\u2019re here / We\u2019re here because we\u2019re here because we\u2019re here because we\u2019re here / We\u2019re here because . . .\u201d etc.\nSome of the reasons we got involved in Vietnam were supporting France in its postwar reconstruction, opposing the USSR, opposing China, supporting Thailand, proving our reliability as an ally (big for LBJ), maintaining access to SEAsian resources (less important than some think), etc. But none of them was the \u201creal reason\u201d because - in the sense of a single cause that explains it all - no such \u201creal reason\u201d existed.", "As with European communism, Third World communist movements, beginning with Castro, were about keeping liberal elites from owning, and effectively running, their countries. So, liberal elites, who stand to lose much, are the real progenitors of the \u201cred scares\u201d. The liberal elites clearly understood that since they were so despised by everybody, that if one country nationalized their holdings, or managed to keep them out, this practice would no doubt spread. This is the real rationale behind the domino theory.\nSmart people understand that communism is to be feared. Even if everything the liberals have to say about the Nazis is true, they are still humanitarians compared to the communists.", "During the Second World War, the Allies sought out all the support they could find and in Occupied nations, this tended to be nationalist, or communist, or both. As a result, the Allies made promises of post-war support and provided both weapons and training.\nAt war\u2019s end, colonialism returned to where it had existed prior to the war, disregarding local nationalism. The result was conflict.\nMeanwhile, the U.S.A. saw the Bamboo Curtain\nas a threat, much as it viewed the Iron Curtain in Europe. The Bamboo Curtain in 1959. The Curtain itself is in black. Note that at the time, Laos\nwas allied with the United States\n, as the Communist\nPathet Lao\ndid not take over the country until 1975. Also, North\nand South Vietnam\nhad not yet been united\n. The boundaries of the now-independent former Soviet republics\nare anachronistically shown for context:\nNationalism, communism, it made no difference to the U.S.A., which decided - in opposition to the U.S. forces that had been helping the Vietnamese - to support a weak, corrupt regime in the south.\nKorea, Taiwan, Indonesia - right across the region - the U.S.A. picked its stooges and began to fight.\nIt really was as simple as that; nothing clever, no clear understanding of the issues, just a bunch of \u2018suits\u2019 in Washington playing to the (anti-commie) crowd.\nThe fighting began (and ended) with self-justifying lies:\nGulf of Tonkin incident\nThe Gulf of Tonkin incident (Vietnamese\n: S\u1ef1 ki\u1ec7n V\u1ecbnh B\u1eafc B\u1ed9), also known as the USS Maddox incident, was an international confrontation that led to the United States\nbeing drawn more directly into the Vietnam War\n. It involved either one or two separate confrontations involving North Vietnam\nand the United States in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin\n. The original American report blamed North Vietnam for both incidents, but eventually became very controversial with widespread claims that either one or both incidents were false\n, and possibly deliberately so. The original US claim was that on August 2, 1964, the destroyer\nUSS\nMaddox\n, while performing a signals intelligence\npatrol as part of DESOTO\noperations, was pursued by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron.[2]\n[3]\nMaddox fired three warning shots and the North Vietnamese boats then attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire.[3]\nMaddox expended over 280 3-inch and 5-inch shells in what was claimed to be a sea battle\n. One U.S. aircraft was damaged, three North Vietnamese torpedo boats\nwere allegedly damaged, and four North Vietnamese sailors were said to have been killed, with six more wounded. There were no U.S. casualties.[4]\nMaddox \"was unscathed except for a single bullet hole from a Vietnamese machine gun round\".[3]\nIt was originally claimed by the National Security Agency\nthat a Second Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred on August 4, 1964, as another sea battle, but instead evidence was found of \"Tonkin ghosts\"[5]\n(false radar images) and not actual North Vietnamese torpedo boats. In the 2003 documentary The Fog of War\n, the former United States Secretary of Defense\nRobert S. McNamara\nadmitted that the August 2 USS Maddox attack happened with no Defense Department\nresponse, but the August 4 Gulf of Tonkin attack never happened.[6]\nIn 1995, former Secretary of Defense McNamara\nmet with former Vietnam People's Army\nGeneral V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p\nto ask what happened on August 4, 1964 in the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident. \"Absolutely nothing\", Gi\u00e1p replied.[7]\nGi\u00e1p claimed that the attack had been imaginary.[8]\nBe careful about laughing at conspiracy theories.", "This answer was posted by me on another forum\nThe involvement was based on a theory called the domino effect.\nIn the years after World War 2, the west had already seen the Soviets bring all of Eastern Europe and North Korea under communists rule. The fear was that communist parties in Italy and Greece would further extend Soviet creeping influence in Europe.\nThat is why the USA gave billions in Marshall Plan aid, to help a war weakened Europe rebuild, be less prone to left wing revolutions, and, of course, return to strong market economies that would be markets for American exports.\nIn 1948 Stalin attempted to blockade Berlin and force the western powers out. Then to America's great shock, the whole of China fell to the commies in 1949. Then in 1950 North Korea invaded the south and the US and its allies had to go to war to prevent the whole of Korea falling to the communist block. Communism was spreading and the fear was that once a country fell to communism, nearby countries would be at risk of falling over, and communism would spread further, knocking over pro western regimes like a line of dominoes.\nNow to Vietnam. France was already struggling with a communists and nationalist movement in Vietnam in the 1950s, and Britain was fighting an insurgency in Malaysia. The 2 countries had different outcomes. The French were defeated, leaving North Vietnam in the Soviet sphere, while in Malaysia, the British managed to isolate the Communists (who were mainly ethnic Chinese) from the Malay majority, ensuing that the insurgency did not get enough popularity to take hold.\nBut communism was still spreading, and in 1959 Cuba fell to Castro, the reds were now on Americas doorstep. In the 50s and sixties, Soviet allied movements spread to central Africa and many regimes in the Middle East were falling under a left wing socialist Arab nationalist movement.\nSo you can see why US foreign policy really feared this Domino effect, it seems at the time that communism had an unstoppable momentum, and at this rate more and more states would fall.\nSo the response was called containment. The US couldn't roll back communism without the risk of setting off a third world war, if the Soviets intervened. The best bet was to stop all future communist expansion, before things got out of hand. So with North Vietnam threatening the South, as well as Laos, Cambodia and the whole region, the stage was set. It was this far and no further.\nWith the French out and South Vietnam's own government increasingly unpopular and weak, America found itself ever more committed to keeping the South in the western sphere, first with advisors and material aid and then with ever increasing amounts of boots on the ground.\nThis containment happened elsewhere as well, but not at such a cost. The US isolated Cuba, shored up anti communists in Central and South America, and shored up its forces guarding Europe, Japan and Korea.\nWe of course know that the massive US involvement in Vietnam was never going to be enough. All the firepower, and the men were not enough. The Southern government was just too unpopular and corrupt to galvanise enough solid indigenous support to combat the more popular left wing insurgency.\nBut the dominoes didn't always fall elsewhere, communism was largely contained. The Soviet system, however had huge successes post war and was a system that really had to be reckoned with. Right into the late seventies, the communist block was still going strong.\nBut by the eighties the cracks were appearing and its economic system could not keep up with the west's economic growth, ability to finance more advanced weapons and the new explosion in computing (see the Farewell Dossier\n). But that's another story\u2026", "Following World War II, the US adopted a \u201ccontainment policy\u201d concerning Communism.

He wanted to grant equal rights including voting to the Empire\u2019s Slavic peoples. This did not sit well with Serbian nationalists or Gavrilo Princeps group Mlada Bos that wanted to create a united Slavic nation, a Yugoslavia.", "The Black Hand was a Serbian ultra-nationalist secret society dedicated to enlarging the Serbian state, with the ultimate goal of recreating the medieval Serbian Empire.\nArchduke Franz-Ferdinand was the heir apparent to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and since his father Franz Josef was 84 years old in 1914 his time was coming. The Archduke represented a major threat to Serbian nationalist aspirations because of his plans to give Slavic citizens of the Empire greater autonomy and self-rule.\nThe Empire was known as the Dual Monarchy, because the kings of Austria and Hungary each had sovereignty in their own realm. But the Empire also contained many Slavic citizens; Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats, Ukrainians and Poles, and they didn\u2019t have the same kind of representation at the highest levels of government. Franz-Ferdinand wanted to change that.\nHis marriage to a Czech lady threatened to change the world:\nFrom: Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg - Wikipedia\nThe old emperor disapproved of the marriage; he didn\u2019t consider her a suitable match - but for the Black Hand this romance created a mortal threat to their dreams of glory.\nThe Black Hand wanted to kill Sophie and Franz Ferdinand for two reasons: first, to prevent the Slavic population of Central Europe from getting a stake in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. That would pull the rug out from under their Serbian Empire before it could even get started. But second, it would precipitate a general European war, where Russia could destroy the Austrian threat for them.\nWe know the Black Hand and Russia coordinated the planning and execution of the Sarajevo assassination due to the extraordinary trial records of Dragutin Dimitrijevic, boss of the Black Hand and head of Serbian Military Intelligence: Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107 - Wikipedia\n(known as \u201cApis\u201d).\nApis was executed in 1917 when the Serbian government feared Germany would win the war and all the information about the assassination would come to light. There was a show-trial, where Apis was allowed to testify in his own defense. That testimony came out many years later, revealing he not only planned the assassination in concert with the Russian government, but Russia actually provided the funds to train, equip, transport and maintain the hit squad sent to Sarajevo. David MacKenzie is the foremost English-language scholar of modern Serbian history, and he details the life and death of Dimitrijevic: David MacKenzie - Apis: the Congenial Conspirator the Life of Colonel Dragutin T Dimitrijevice Congenial Conspirator\n. Well worth reading if you have any interest in WWI or politics in general.\nThe wikipedia page on the Black Hand claims that the involvement of Apis in the Sarajevo assassination is still \u201cin dispute\u201d but the evidence presented by MacKenzie looks ironclad. Apis had no reason to lie in his testimony, and indeed was considered a national hero in Serbia, then and now. He was willing to sacrifice himself for the cause, when it appeared his death would be more useful than his survival. He killed to make sure his fellow-Slavs didn\u2019t have a better life.", "The Black Hand\u2019s core objective was to achieve a \u201cGreater Serbia\u201d, that is, to unite all territories populated by Serbs with the Kingdom of Serbia.

Franz Ferdinand, as heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was one of the most senior figures in their hierarchy, and to people like the Black Hand he was a prime symbol of foreign rule and oppression over their fellow Serbs. I\u2019m not sure of how their logic ran that assassinating the Archduke would cause the liberation of Serbs living in Bosnia and their reunion with their fellow Serbs, considering the sequence of events that actually happened when the assassination took place (stipulating that the union did happen - for seventy years or so, anyway - after World War I in the form of Yugoslavia), but from what I know the Black Hand quite probably expected intervention by Russia, Serbia\u2019s traditional ally and patron, to force Austria-Hungary to stand down and withdraw from Bosnia, thus making reunion possible.

If Europeans did not want to fight Germany to protect themselves, why would an antiwar, isolationist America send troops there. If this question is to get help for an alternative history board or role playing game, in the tense world scenario we live within, I have not time to spend helping people with that.\nThis is how a war would have played out and not on German soil. Germany had no navy to speak of and no aircraft carriers. America had seven big, frontline carriers at the beginning of the war. Germany is a small country with limited resources within its own borders. Many of its natural materials came from lands captured during the war. America was and is one of the world's largest nations with enormous natural resources and a large, independent minded populace, which at the time was extremely hard working and tough, many having come from farm families and factory worker families and all having experienced the Great Depression (as Germans did). An example of her wealth, today the U.S. has more oil reserves under the earth than any other country, and maybe as much as all other countries combined. At the time of the war, America also possessed, as it does to an extent now, a strong entrepreneurial class of investors and innovators full of ideas and willing to gamble their money on new business ideas and products. As an example, cargo ships made with concrete hulls were produced in America during the war to conserve badly needed steel.\nWith the massively larger American supply of human and natural resources, a bigger naval fleet, aircraft carriers, and a enormously larger land mass, protected on two side by large oceans, America was a country that would have been impossible for Germany to defeat. To prove the point, during the Pacific phase, in the \u201cPacific Theater of Operations\u201d America was pitted against Japan, a country possessing similar resources as Germany and with the same supply disadvantages. Japan started the war with similar production weaknesses to Germany, in comparison to the U.S. but with a 10 to 7 advantage in the all important aircraft carrier in a large ocean war. The Pacific covers one third of the earth and is larger than all of the dry land on earth combined. As the war progressed, America destroyed all of the Japan carriers while she produced and deployed 36 large, new, frontline carriers for the U.S. Navy. Japan built none and completed one under production before the war, which was lost.\nIn combat, American troops were good at independent decisions when without commander nearby, something their two major opponents may have been a bit weaker at, possibly because they came from much more authoritarian cultures.\nThe only reasons America was threatened by either of her two major Second World War opponents was they surprise involvement of America at the beginning and her lack of preparedness because she did not want to be involved in a war and intended to stay out of it. Though the fight would be tough and there were setbacks that exposed American territory to great risks (including the loss of her Philippine colony in the very beginning), there was no chance of either opponent defeating America alone, one on one, during the war. Even if attacked by both at the same time, after a terribly rough defense of the American West on American soil, after a possible but not certain Japanese invasion, America would have been victorious. Germany had no way to project its limited power to America. Hitler could never even pull off an invasion of Britain across the English Channel, when he controlled the Continent only miles away and Britain was on the ropes. How would he get an invasion armada to America against her carrier fleet. When the Axis powers in Europe were assaulted up through Italy and on the shores of France, though Germany held the Continent, she had to struggle because of the people of the occupied lands did not want her on their soil. And, ultimately, she had to declare war on her main ally, Italy. In a similar scenario, during an attempt to invade America, Germany and Japan would be trying to conquer a giant, continent-wide land occupied with a large, fully armed and supplied unified populace.", "Germany would lose, one way or another. Since no other nations are involved, these are the German borders\nThe United States would quickly exit the Great Depression, then would likely move the navy to blockade Germany. This is how aircraft carriers would prove their worth, anti submarine action and Doolittle like attacks. Naval landings would occur on the Eastern side of polish corridor and would likely fail the first time, but experience would likely lead to the invasion succeeding later. Meanwhile the German industry would be sputtering to a halt due to the blockade and constant bombing. The submarines would fought off with carrier islands and an ever growing number of destroyers. The Eastern side of the polish corridor would turned into a large airbase and invasion preparation site. Eventually a successful landing would occur and Germanys fate would be sealed.\nEdit: This is not how it would actually go. I just wanted to not have to explain that the \u201cwar\u201d would be economic and trade based.", "So, in your imagined war, the United States, for some reason, attacks Germany in 1940 and no other country gets involved?\nWhy does this make any sense at all? Why would the US attack Germany? Does Germany have resources the US wants or needs?\nCountries go to war for a reason, not just because the generals were bored and didn\u2019t have anything else to do. What is the reason for the US attacking Germany?", "The premise of your battle is flawed. Wars are fought in the air and sea too, and limiting the battle to a particular timeframe in which the U.S. wasnt even an active party is similarly strange. Obviously, the U.S. entered the war in late \u201841, so we\u2019re fighting an imaginary war with a country that wasnt yet in the war? It really makes no sense. But let's move it to 1942 to 1945, which is the same amount of time. This gives a better point of comparison.\nGermany would win in the first few months, then the U.S. would have taken it from there, as actually happened with the Pacific war with Japan. The U.S. wasn\u2019t prepared for war whereas Germany had been preparing for a decade, so that would give them an early advantage. However, as we saw in Russia, the Germans had no capability to carry on an extended war, and an inneffective supply chain that still heavily depended on horse and oxen. As a result, they were ground to a halt and surrounded by the Russians at the battles of Stalingrad and Leningrad.\nI\u2019m afraid the war could have been won by the rules of resources, supply and production. The U.S. had a compartively limitless amount of natural resources, triple the manufacturing capability, triple the shipping capacity and double the population. Also, the Germans had not developed any truly effective aerial bombing capability. They couldnt even bring nearby Britain to its knees with their bombing campaign prior to U.S. entry into the war. The vast distances between cities and bases in the U.S. and overseas bases means that it had an almost innate advantage in the capability to project power across distances. The air war would have stifled Germany's material production capacity. -As it actually did.\nBut the U.S.\u2019s ace in the hole was the ineffective German command structure. The Germans had masterful Generals like Erwin Rommel, and Erich Von Manstein, who was arguably the best General in the war, but they were constantly being stifled by rivalries between factions, branches and divisions, and overruled by leaders such as Goering, who would probably be an acceptable commander for the German Luftwaffe, but was a sometimes inneffectual drug addict, and woefully unqualified to coordinate the effective use of the entire Wehrmacht.\nAnd as the German High Command tended to allow moslty downward flow of military command and control, many German field commanders became extraordinarily frustrated with missed opportunities and losses that didnt need to happen. Then there was the best ally the Allies ever had. - Hitler. He had a stranglehold on the control of military decisions, despite the fact that his sole military experience (in WW1) was as an infantryman and message runner. His mismanagement of resources, and lack of strategic and tactical knowledge could easily be described as being a major factor in Germany's loss. For example, many historians believe that if Rommel had full control of defensive resources deployed in France during the D-Day invasion, the Allies could have been halted at or driven back to the beaches where they landed. Hitler disagreed with Rommel's idea of keeping the Panzer divisions near the Normandy coast; instead deploying them nearer to Paris. Hitler often chose his leadership based on gut feelings, not by education and experience. For example, he selected Albert Speer, a young architect, to basically coordinate and maintain the entire German infrastructure, even though he had no experience. His reasons? - Because he'd developed a personal relationship with Speer when he was assisting Hitler to design the Reich Chancellory. Hitler too often ignored experienced individuals for leadership positions in favor or those with whom he enjoyed socializing.\nSome may argue that \u2018The Germans were figjting a two-front war,\u2019 You just won my argument for me. That is exactly my point regarding Hitler. It was a major tactical blunder. If he had not attacked the Soviet Union, he could have concentrated their efforts on Britain, France and the U.S. The German High Command was very fond of shooting itself in the foot. Another example of this was that the U.S. was actively seeking atomic weapons, whereas Hitler had relegated those efforts to a sideshow for Germany. Those weapons could likely have been the trump card in any total war. Although their use against Germany would have been in doubt because U.S. war planners feared the Germans could back-engineer the weapons much more quickly than the Japanese if the bomb hadn't detonated.\nSo, no, Nazi Germany would have stood little chance against the U.S. in such a war.

If it is the latter, this answer is better. If it is about dating methods, please read on.\nThere are several dating methods, each with its limitations. Carbon dating, which is a radiometric dating using radioactive decay from to , is useful for dating evidence as long as it is not older than some 40,000 years.\nBut the key thing is context. If you find a dead cat, all you can say that it is a cat and it is dead. But what if you found the dead cat on the road? Or on the chopping block in a kitchen? Context is the difference between someone\u2019s lunch and a roadkill.\nIn archaeology, context is really important. If we find a skeleton below the foundation of a house, we know that the skeleton is older than the house, which in turn gives us a minimum age. Bones in an iron age midden can be associated with that period. Dendrodating uses tree rings to date when a piece of wood would have been felled at the earliest. Cultural artefacts, like pottery or jewelry, can also be used to date the context of the bones. Funeral practices are an important clue. So it is not as much the bones themselves that gives us a date, but the context.\nIf it is older than that, we\u2019re leaving historical and archaeological settings, and instead we go into palaeontology. Then there are other tools in the toolbox, but it\u2019s still about context. There\u2019s still radiometric dating, but instead of carbon dating, they use other radiometric clocks. Uranium-lead is one, used for volcanic rocks. Uranium-thorium is another, used for sedimentary rocks. Potassium-argon is useful for dating feldspar, etc.\nNote that I am talking rock layers here: the fossils themselves are hard to date on their own, and certainly not through carbon dating, since there is hardly any carbon left and it is way beyond the resolution of carbon dating. So we look at the context: in which rock layer is if found, and in what order in that rock layer.\nYou don\u2019t necessarily have to do that for every fossil you found \u2013 often, it is already done for rock layers, so just finding the bones in a particular layer will automatically date it.", "Probably the most used method is carbon dating. All these methods make assumptions so often are wildly inaccurate. You may find this information interesting:\nCarbon dating-who is fooling whom?", "Paleontologists have made extensive studies of early animals and if the bone piece is big enough they can identify what type of bone and the animal it is likely to come from.\nMost finds are quite small so the field workers will evacuate the area surrounding the first find in order to attempt to gather other relevant pieces. With enough pieces the scientists try to put the bones together, rather like a difficult jigsaw, and see if this helps with identification. There are now many databases that they can use which is helpful. Easy communication through the internet allows scientists from other countries to collaborate.\nStudies are being carried out to improve the use of DNA in studies of archaelogical finds.

In fact, homosexual relationships were the norm among Spartan warriors who generally lived together in barracks and who were allowed to marry women but had to conceal their marital relations from their fellows by only meeting their wives at night.\nTherefore the common misconception that Spartan warriors were the epitome of masculinity and completely heterosexual is completely false.", "That Sparta was some sort of proto-fascist state filled with illiterate brutes who spent all their time brutally abusing their own children before going off to war every day while their wives were a bunch of lesbians. The misconceptions about Sparta are so egregious, widespread and ridiculous no one historian can ever address them all.\nImages of a society characterized by brutal, mindless discipline and a merciless emphasis on physical fitness, but lacking artistic and intellectual accomplishments \u2013 or even basic literacy \u2013 predominate in popular literature. In fact, ancient Sparta \u2013 or Lacedaemon, as it was known in ancient Greece \u2013 was far more complex and multifaceted. Plutarch claims that \"devotion to the intellect is more characteristic of Sparta than love of physical exercise.\" Lindsay Wheeler calls the Spartans warrior philosophers.\nIn the ancient world Sparta was admired as much for its constitution, its system of education, its philosophical culture, its economic self-sufficiency, its diplomacy, and its music and dance as it was for its famous hoplites. Not her kings, but her citizens \u2013 the lawgiver Lycurgus, the philosopher Chilon, and the poet Tyrtaios \u2013 were the most widely admired Spartans in ancient times.\nBelow is a summary of some key facts:\nSparta was the first democracy in recorded history, predating Athenian democracy by at least 50 and possibly 100 years. Furthermore, Sparta was the only Greek city-state to introduce land reform aimed at equalizing wealth among its citizens.\nThe Spartan public educational system, the agoge, trained the mind as well as the body, and Spartans were not only literate, but admired for their intellectual culture and verbal skills. Socrates himself says \"the most ancient and fertile homes of philosophy among the Greeks are Crete and Sparta, where are found more sophists than anywhere on earth.\" (Plato, Protagoras, 343b:366.) Certainly, Spartan wit and mastery of rhetoric were so widely admired that ancient Greek scholars collected Spartan sayings, and the laconic style of speech was studied and imitated in intellectual circles.\nSparta was the capital city of the large, prosperous, and economically powerful city-state of Lacedaemon. The economy of Lacedaemon was diverse, based on a wealth of natural resources and abundant fertile land. While trading in luxury goods, self-sufficiency in grain gave Sparta a significant political advantage.\nSparta was the only Greek city-state in which women enjoyed elementary rights such as the right to education, inheritance, and property. Furthermore, Spartan women prided themselves on their intellectual accomplishments, possessed economic power, and were not afraid to express their opinions \u2013 leading other Greeks to condemn them as undisciplined, dangerous, and immoral.\nThe high status of women is the best refutation of persistent allegations that Spartan society institutionalized pederasty; modern psychology has demonstrated that the victims of pederasty usually grow up to be misogynous men. There is no convincing contemporary evidence that homosexuality was more common in Sparta than elsewhere in ancient Greece.\nSparta was the first Greek city-state to develop a complex system of mutual defense treaties, and it repeatedly intervened to defend democracy against tyranny. Spartan diplomacy was arguably even more effective than Spartan arms in maintaining Sparta's status for centuries.\nAlthough Spartans were proud to say that they built their monuments \"in flesh\" \u2013 meaning that the virtue and courage of Sparta's citizens were the greatest monuments to the city-state \u2013 they were not lacking in architectural and artistic achievements. The ancient Greek tour guide, Pausanias, cataloged hundreds of sites worth seeing. Nor was Sparta itself a collection of rural villages, as Athenian detractors depicted it, but rather a prosperous capital city with broad, tree-lined avenues, temples, monuments, public buildings, and royal palaces.\nSpartan music and dance were famous throughout the ancient world, and the oldest recorded heterosexual love poem was the work of a Spartan poet praising Spartan maidens.\nFor more about Sparta visit: http://spartareconsidered.blogspot.com", "That they were some war-obsessed maniacs.

All of them were very bright and extremely hard working. But they had to work with the technology, budget, and other limitations of their country and its place in the world.\nIn 1998, I accompanied 7 or 8 senior Russian cosmonauts and designers to the grand opening of the Saturn V center at the Kennedy Space Center. I was the deputy director of the Shuttle-Mir/Phase 1 Program that flew 7 Americans on the Mir, and these gentlemen were at KSC for the launch of STS 89. The grand opening happened to coincide with the launch.\nI was responsible for keeping an eye on our Russian guests, but by this point in the program they were pretty comfortable getting around on their own. So once I knew they were in the facility I went off and visited with Gene Cernan and others.\nToward the end of the evening, I joined the Russians as they stood under the engine bells of the first stage. The senior Russian in the group was Valeri Ryumin, the Russian Mir program manager. Although his emotions were well lubricated with alcohol, that incredibly tough cosmonaut (who was a tank commander in the Russian army before joining their space program) was in tears admiring the Saturn and wishing that his country had been able to build its equivalent. It was the only time I ever saw him admire our hardware. Despite flying on STS 91, he was no fan of the Shuttle.", "No. Their moon program didn't have enough funding, and Soviet manufacturing wasn't up to the job.", "Korolev was a brilliant engineer, and an immensely capable designer. He is, rightly so, listed among the greats of the 20th Century in helping Mankind reach outer space.\nBut, there was never really any chance that the Soviets would get to the Moon sooner than the United States\u2014barring some sort of catastrophe at Cape Kennedy.\nHere\u2019s a link to a discussion of the N-1 rocket the Soviets intended to take their cosmonauts to the Moon.\nN1 (rocket) - Wikipedia\nLook at the first stage engines. There are thirty (30) of them. This is the crucial engineering limitation of Soviet rocket design. They were unable to manufacture the huge engines the United States used for its Saturn V launch vehicle. Having to create a pumping system that would provide identical fuel supplies to 30 engines simultaneously during the critical lift off phase was simply not possible. So, the N1 failed again and again.\nWithout this heavy lift capacity, no cosmonaut was going to the Moon.\nSoviet booster design was robust, but all too often relied upon multiple boosters strapped together to push large payloads into orbit. All well and good, until you want to boost a large load to escape velocity, and plan to land part of that payload on another celestial body.\nTaking nothing away from Korolev, he was just the victim of a country that had aspirations of reaching the stars, but limited technology to get them there.", "Would the Soviets reach the Moon first had not the chief Soviet engineer Sergei Korolev died so early?\nNo, Korolev\u2019s death was a secondary factor. The Soviet problem was that they really didn\u2019t join the race to the moon until 1965, when Khrushchev (not a fan of space exploration) was ousted from power and the USSR finally diverted some effort to a moon mission. (Prior to that, most USSR rocket construction and development work went to the military. The USSR\u2019s incredible space achievements prior to Apollo were basically done with scraps pried away from the Soviet military.)\nFor a Russian assessment of what the Soviets did wrong, I\u2019d recommend this lengthy article summarizing their missteps and lack of commitment: Why did the Soviet Union lose the Moon Race?\nMeanwhile, before 1965, the US ran multiple programs to get to the moon:\nIt ran the Project Mercury\nto figure out the basics of crewed space flight\nIt ran the Project Gemini to master tasks required for Apollo to succeed\n, including orbital interception and docking, orbital maneuvering, and spacewalking\nThe Ranger program\n, Surveyor program\n, and Lunar Orbiter program\nwere dedicated to mapping and learning about the moon to figure out how and where humans could land on it. The Pearly Pioneeer probes\nalso provided some support.\nIt started development of Apollo hardware\nin parallel to Mercury and Gemini\nAnd before Apollo or NASA existed, the USAF and DoD had already started developing some of the rocket engines used in the program. Mercury and Gemini flew on rockets developed in the 1950s to blow up the \u201cgodless commie hordes\u201d (Redstone, Atlas, and Titan rockets), and the Saturn V used engines (the mighty Rocketdyne F-1\n) that started development in 1955.\nThe Rooskies didn\u2019t start developing the N-1 rocket until 1965\n, by which time the Saturn V\u2019s first stage engines had been in testing for a decade. They didn\u2019t have a heavy lift rocket in the 1960s that could deliver a sizable crewed payload to the moon in one launch.\nThe difference in approaches in engine testing and development illustrates how far behind the USSR was in the moon race. F-1 engines went through the following testing sequence:\nYears of research and development to perfect the engines and their notorious combustion instability (1955\u20131960s).\nEach production F-1 engine was test-fired at the factory.\nEach Saturn S-IC\n(the Saturn V\u2019s first stage) was test fired as a fully assembled stage in a test rig with all five factory-proven F-1\u2019s firing together. The intact stage was shipped to the launch site by barge.\nThe Saturn IC was thus a proven stage by the time it was launched with a second stage, third stage, and Apollo stack atop it. Test flights of the full Saturn V began with Apollo 4 in 1967, 2 years before Apollo 11.\nAs a result of 14 years of effort leading up to Apollo 11, the Saturn V and Apollo hardware was very reliable.\nThe Soviet approach to the N-1 was:\nOnly build and test the first stage engines in earnest starting in 1965.\nOnly test fire 1 of 3 first stage NK-15 engines at the factory\nstarting in 1967.\nBuild the entire first stage with 30 engines, but never test fire it all together at the factory.\nBreak down the first stage into sections and ship in small pieces by train to the launch site.\nReassemble the chunks at the launch site.\nLaunch it and see what happens.\nUnsurprisingly, the N-1 blew up on all four of its test fights. Despite my emphasis on engine testing in the description above, software in the flight control system was responsible for 3 of 4 N-1 failures.\nAs noted by the Soviets themselves\n, to get to the moon before the Americans, they needed:\nA focused organization like NASA rather than a rambling mess of individual bureaus pursuing different scientific goals on scraps from the military\u2019s table\nMore than 10% of NASA\u2019s budget, but that\u2019s all they got\nBetter quality control in factories, where the Soviets considered their own workers unskilled and undisciplined\nA start long before 1965.\nAnd that\u2019s at a minimum.

No doubt,ancient scriptures are real form of science, Therefore Sastra is regarded as science. Howevver, we cannot say that ancient technologies are more advanced. Modern technologies are based on machine\\ artificial Intelligence. Ancient technologies were based on pure mind/natural Intelligence. Ancient mind of our seers were cultivated and able to perform any work without machine.\nWe cannot say that ancient scriptures are more advance in technology. Ancient scriptures are rich in theories but lacking in practical application. Modern science and technology given opportunities to develop those thoughts by using modern technology. Modern technology is based on artificial intelligence and more advance than ancient technology. But they are missing heart and mind in their application.. Heart is missing, theories of ancient wisdom must be apply through multimedia for presenting new reaserch for resolving various present problems like coronavirus and other calamitis.\nWe always claim that our scriptures are treasure of knowledge and information science because we have faith in the words of our scriptures i.e. Vedas and its allied . There are several passages in Vedas and their allied subjects which clearly mention that the Science of Vedas is the supreme if taken into consideration for research work in any field of studies of all times.\nThe Science, in the term of Vedic literature, is the source of all kinds of knowable objects. Therefore, Vedas are revealed texts rather than manmade. The basic difference between revealed text and manmade text is that former is the source of knowledge while latter is the source of information. Thus, all the texts other than the Vedic literature, which are manmade, subject to test in our practical life for being authority.\nHowever, this concept seems to be biases in the context of modern sciences. In fact, both might be consider on the logical point of view and must be in conformity to each other.\nModern cognitive science deals with multiple research disciplines such as psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, and anthropology. On the other hand in Sanskrit, Vedic or Classical, there are many thoughts and schools which through light on the theories, religious practices, social sciences, spiritual &physical sciences and thus provide sufficient materials on philosophy, Soteriology and various other relevant topics which can be compare with the concepts of modern sciences. But the distinctive feature of ancient Indian literature lies in this fact that in its any system we find source materials for the analysis of cognitive science with its all aspects.\nBut, anyhow we cannot say that ancient scriptures are more advance in technology. Ancient scriptures are rich in theories but lacking in practical application. Modern science and technology given opportunities to develop those thoughts by using modern technology.

In the sense, if I give you 2 pieces of technology it can be arranged on the line with one end signifying less powerful and other end signifying more powerful. This might be true in some cases but false in most. Like if I tell you fission bomb and fusion bomb. It would be easy to say that a fusion bomb is more advanced than fission bombs. But what if I tell you antimatter bomb and mind control technology. Here I don't mean control other people's minds, but control one\u2019s own mind. Which do you think is more powerful?\nThe entire Hindu scriptures are based on Mind Control Technique. Whether it is Yoga or Meditation or any spiritual practices. It is all about being able to control one's Mind.\nToday, what is the approach of Western knowledge? It makes individuals learn the concept of learning for the initial 20 years of their lives. You don't do anything else but learn to learn, that's it.\nNext 4\u20137 years, depending on craft, they study the concepts they are interested in. They completely submerged in the topics of the field. They work on it, day in and day out. Then once in a while, they have an Epiphany. There are a lot of other words for that moment. Trying to solve a problem and it clicked. Or \u201cIt just came to me\u201d moment.\nNevertheless, it is like throwing a dart in the dark and hoping that it hits the target. And sometimes it hits by luck. That is the reason, it takes so much time to solve a problem. Like, find the treatment for a disease or develop a new method of problem-solving or new mathematical models.\nHindu system was very different. Along with focusing on developing good character and knowledge base for the individual during the initial years of development, they also focused heavily on Mind-Control techniques like Meditation and Yoga. So, instead of Epiphany to happen by chance, they actually will it to happen. But this is a bit more robust system as it can be sustained for extended periods of time. They were even able to identify the drawbacks of the system before actually putting the technique into practice. This is why you see a lot of error-free solutions from olden times. Like Temples build using a monolith. A single chisel mistake would mess the entire project. Another example is creating a verse that has a different sensible meaning depending on the meter used. So, a poetic verse would be available to everyone with a common meter to understand it, but some special people will have a special meter that gives a totally different meaning to the same verse.\neg. There are slokas in Rigveda that are believed to be hymns praising the Gods, but using specific meters it is the value of pi up to 32 decimals. The Value of pi upto 32 decimals from Rig Veda. \u2013 Sanskriti - Hinduism and Indian Culture Website\nMind you just by western suppositions Rigvedas are from around 1200\u20131500 BC. But then there is the reference to the Saraswati river as a mighty river in the Rig Vedas, which is only possible for the time before 3000 BC. So, you can understand the weirdness of finding the value of Pi up to 32 decimals from such an ancient civilization.", "Anything better than yesterday is an advancement today.", "Dear Sir,\nindeed, the technology we had and still possess in the Ancient Scriptures was and still remains advanced as none other.

These people were usually well-received since they were from the same side of the Protestant Reformation schism as those living where they moved and arrived in relatively small numbers.\nThe 1840s saw that demographic change to poor Catholics from the more rural parts of the island where their small plots failed and absentee landlords did not offer much, if any, support or leeway in paying rents. This was a different migration. They were people who could scrape together enough money to reach a port, pay for [usually] steerage tickets, and still have the required money in pocket when they arrived at their destination. Empty pockets when you arrived could mean you were sent back as \u201cdestitute\u201d.\nThe earliest immigrants in this wave usually walked of the ship directly into the city at whatever port where they arrived (NYC, Philly, Boston, Baltimore, etc) until 1854. After that, there were immigration controls in place making the process more complicated.\nWhat did they achieve? First, they were alive. Starvation was a very real threat in Ireland so getting out was critical.\nSecond, they didn\u2019t go into the poor house in Ireland. While the poor house was setup to help people it was also the destination of last resort since conditions were harsh, families split up, and many didn\u2019t live to leave.\nThird, they now had opportunities to find work and provide for their families. Many sent money back to Ireland or saved money to bring other family members. If you find an immigrant traveling alone you might be seeing the first to leave\u2026 or watch where they went because they were probably meeting someone who had arrived earlier.\nMost of these immigrants were not highly educated or trained in advanced skills. They were generally farmers. Others did emigrate but the bulk were farmers or shepherds. So, the first jobs they got were as general labor or low-skilled entry-level jobs.\nRailroads were in a building boom throughout the latter half of the 19th century so there was lots of work with canals and later railroads. Farm labor was always available as well. And, then, in the cities many ended up as police or firemen or some other type of service job.\nFourth, once they had work they could start a family so they married and had children. Usually, lots of children because it was a tradition for farming families - even those now in the cities - and the Catholic Church pushed the \u201cgo forth and multiply\u201d and contraception was basically illegal.

There are a few reasons we need to take this statistic with a grain of salt in particular. Firstly, this was a statistic taken from 2015, so it is already inaccurate. Secondly, there are many philosophical questions like what constitutes a human, and from what point in time do we start our estimate. Thirdly, there is absolutely no way we could ever know the correct number for sure, but for the sake of answering this question, we\u2019ll use it anyways as a vague estimate.\nNext, according to How many people die and how many are born each year?\n, in the year 2020, the projected birth rate is about 140,000,000 births per year, and the projected death rate is about 60,000,000 per year. For the sake of simplicity and since we just can\u2019t be sure of future trends, we are going to assume that these rates will not change.\nHere\u2019s what our equation looks like:\n7,800,000,000 + 140,000,000x = 100,800,000,000 + 60,000,000x\nWhat this equation is saying is there are currently 7.8 billion people in the world, and this number grows by 140 million people per year, and we want this to equal the 100.8 billion people that are already dead as well as the additional 60 million people that die every year. By solving for x, which represents years, this equation will tell us in how many years these numbers will be equal (and since the rate of growth is larger than the rate of death, we can assume that this will very quickly mean that there will be more living people than there have ever been dead people).\n80,000,000x = 93,000,000,000\nx = 1,162.5\nThis means that if we continue forward at the same rate of births and deaths every year, the amount of people living will equal that total amount of dead people in 1,162.5 years from now.\nThis answer should of course not be taken too seriously because like I said, we don\u2019t know how many people have actually died in human history before now, and the rates of births and deaths per year will most certainly change.

So, despite doing this to everyone else, communists mostly did not murder or torture mathematicians.\nBut your perspective is misguided, attempting to attribute the prominence of Russian or Central European mathematicians to communism in any fashion. It was in fact the opposite. Communism was destructive. Because mathematicians were not tortured or murdered, they just continued with traditions, traditions created before communism. Both Egorov and Luzin were educated and raised before communism. Over time, quality of work and output declined. Same happened in other communist countries.

The coincidence of the Danelaw with the old Angle-identified areas is quite striking, and suggests that if anything it was the Angles who could reconcile themselves without too much difficulty to scarcely foreign Danish rule. In subsequent decades there are signs that the Angles, or at least the Angle nobility, especially in Northumbria, were inclined to prefer local Danish to distant Saxon rule.", "What oppression? Seriously what is it with you and this frickin Saxons Vs Angles obsession? Angels and Saxons considered themselves one people by this point (Similar to European or American) the Great Danish Army came to Britain. Mercia found the eatern half of its territory annexed, thus was reliant on Wessex and willing to accept Alfred as overall leader of the Anglo-Saxon resistance to the Danes.\nAnglo-Saxons did serve along the Danes but only either because they were forced to, or to profit themselves such as Aethelwold. Aethelwold was next in line to the throne of Wessex following the death of his father, that being Alfred's (Alfred the Great) brother Aethelred, but he was too young and the situation called for an immediate successor, so Alfred inherited the throne. Alfred would cut Aethelwold out of the line of succession in favour of his own family. When Alfred died, Aethelwold tried to contest the throne of Wessex with Alfred's son Edward the Elder, Aethelwold lost. Angered, Aethelwold fled to Northumbria and convinced a Viking army of backing him against Wessex.\nFrom Northumbria, Aethelwold and his army sailed to East Anglia, who since the surrender of Guthrum at the Battle of Edington, had been largely at peace with the Anglo-Saxons. Aethelwold was able to raise an Army in East Anglia and attacked Mercia, Edward retaliated with an attack into East Anglia and the forces led by Aethelwold tried to intercept them. Edward decided to retreat when he deemed a direct conflict too risky, but a detachment of Kentish elite refused and engaged the Vikings. The Kentish were completely wiped out, though impressively dealt some serious blows to the Vikings, who lost not only Aethelwold, but a Danish Viking king, at least 2 Danish nobleman, a minor noble from the Mercian court and some of their elite fighters.\nHow about actually taking time to educate yourself about the time period?

It greatly suited her persona as the most eligible marriage suit in Europe. She was also a most accomplished dissembler, and I have recently completed the text of a book, Elizabeth\u2019s Secret Lover: Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (to be published by Pen and Sword in 2020), which provides compelling evidence that Lord Robert Dudley\nwas her lover in the full sense. Elizabeth was very much attracted to the devastatingly good looking Dudley, her Master of Horse, who she had known since childhood. She was obsessed with him and showered him with gifts and perquisites. There is really no disagreement that, if Elizabeth had had a free hand, she would have chosen Dudley as her husband. None of her later favourites achieved a similar rapport with her.\nUnfortunately, William Cecil\n, Elizabeth\u2019s Secretary of State, strongly disapproved of her marrying Dudley. This is not to suggest that they particularly disliked each other, and Cecil much admired Dudley\u2019s unfailing loyalty to the Queen, but he wanted Elizabeth to make a political marriage as the means of protecting England from Continental Catholic attack. Furthermore, Cecil was extremely cautious, and he disapproved of Dudley\u2019s more \u2018hawkish\u2019 foreign policy and his support for Calvinist ministers, bent on undermining the structure of the Episcopalian Anglican church that both both Elizabeth and Cecil had done much to set up. Dudley\u2019s aura of Puritan demeanour seemed to sit uncomfortably with rumours of a more chequered private life.\nIn the early part of Elizabeth\u2019s reign, Dudley remained married to Amy Robsart, who had not provided him with children, and was now living in Oxfordshire, suffering from breast cancer. Cecil was not averse to a few devious tricks, and he saw Amy\u2019s illness as a means of tarnishing Dudley\u2019s name. In 1560, he spread rumours that Elizabeth and Dudley were only waiting for Amy\u2019s death so that they could marry. He even suggested that Amy was in danger of being murdered. When Amy, very unfortunately was found with a broken neck at the bottom of a couple of steps a few days later, Cecil only had to ask whether Amy fell or was she pushed. No modern historians believe there was foul play, and Dudley (who had been at Court) was exonerated in the Coroner\u2019s verdict, but Amy\u2019s death hung over him for the rest of his life.\nWith Amy dead, Dudley undoubtedly hoped to marry Elizabeth, and was encouraged by her to undermine any foreign marriage suits as they were put forward by her long suffering ministers. Many have said that they would not have contemplated a sexual relationship, for fear that Elizabeth might become pregnant. On the contrary, it is much more likely that Elizabeth saw pregnancy as her means of gaining support for the marriage to thwart the dynastic hopes of the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots. She could then marry Dudley without opposition from her ministers. So long as their marriage took place before the birth of any child, the child\u2019s legitimacy would not be compromised. (Elizabeth was herself conceived before the marriage of Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn).\nElizabeth always denied that she was in bed with Dudley, but she was an arch dissembler. She also admitted that if she wanted to take a lover, no one could prevent her. Certainly Dudley\u2019s bedchamber at Court was placed next to hers, and it would have been tempting for her to leave her bedroom, which was surrounded by her ladies, and visit Dudley in his. He had a manservant, Tamworth, who slept on a pallet in his bedroom, so it is not unreasonable to assume that Tamworth would have known what was going on. When Elizabeth was suffering from small-pox in 1562, she made a will leaving a pension to Tamworth of \u00a3500 per annum (perhaps \u00a3500,000 in current money). This is an extraordinary sum to leave to a servant unless it were a pay off to keep his mouth shut.\nWe know that Elizabeth did not become pregnant. It is also known that she suffered an irregular menstrual cycle and was only doubtfully fertile. There was no reliable form of contraception in Tudor times, so it is probable that Elizabeth concluded after two years that she was unable to bear children. Certainly when Mary Queen of Scots gave birth to a son, Elizabeth pronounced that she was of barren stock. She had seen the embarrassment of the phantom pregnancies of her sister Mary Tudor, and may have concluded that it was preferable to be a \u2018virgin\u2019 queen than a barren wife.\nCecil remained determined to prevent Dudley from marrying Elizabeth and he proposed a test of his integrity. She was persuaded to ask Dudley to seek Spanish backing for their marriage in return for their support for a Spanish led Counter-Reformation. It seems incredible that Dudley as a staunch puritan would promote such a plan, but it demonstrates that his ambition to marry Elizabeth was of greater importance than his faith. He asked his brother-in-law, Sir Henry Sidney, to make this proposal to de Quadra, the Spanish ambassador. Sir Henry even told de Quadra that Dudley and Elizabeth were lovers. He was in a good position to know as his wife Mary Dudley was one of Elizabeth\u2019s ladies in waiting. Although Dudley confirmed his offer to de Quadra at a later date, when the ambassador raised it with Elizabeth, she backed off. She was shocked that Dudley would take such a step contrary to all his religious beliefs, and she realised that he had failed Cecil\u2019s test of his integrity. It was this that persuaded her to nominate Dudley as a suitable husband for Mary Queen of Scots, with which Cecil heartily agreed.\nDespite this, Elizabeth remained intoxicated with Dudley, and they continued an intermittent relationship until about 1567 when Robert\u2019s affair with Douglas Howard developed. Despite this Elizabeth considered Dudley to have been the love of her life.", "No one is sure. Possibly Thomas Seymour, when she was very young and living with her step-mother Catherine Parr. And possibly Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. She made him Earl and he was a suitor for many years and many people thought she would marry him. They were certainly life long friends. But there is absolutely no evidence that she was anything other than a virgin. Her image as a Virgin was certainly a useful PR tool though and part of her means of maintaining peace was by constantly behaving as if she might marry one European royal or another. This was a strategy for sure.\nI think its extremely unlikely that Essex was her lover. I think she just enjoyed his flattery.\nIf you want to know more read Alison Weir \u2018Elizabeth the Queen\u2019", "I agree with both the other answers, that we will never know for sure.\nHowever, I would argue that there is no compelling evidence that she did not die virgo intacta\nSecondly, there are a lot of very good political and practical reasons why she would have remained a virgin Queen.", "We can never know for certain after all this time, but personally I do not believe she was a physical virgin at the time of her death.

She needed to appear before her subjects as a virgin \u2014 a substitute virgin, as they no longer had a Virgin Mary to venerate and some of them may have been tempted to go back to the \u201cold\" ways, I.e. Catholicism.\nMy money is on her having a secret sexual relationship with the love of her life, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester.", "This is impossible to answer.\nThere will be some who will claim that she was a virgin Queen because there were people in attendance on her all the time but the reality is that these precautions have been relaxed from time to time.

They are therefore rightfully viewed as incompetent and not long for the World and indeed lucky to even exist today. Why either are seen as *villainous* is something for Hollywood not History.", "The Second World War is generally said to have kicked off when Nazi Germany invaded Poland, having been warned by Britain and France that doing so would lead to war. So, that\u2019s sort of a \u201cbad guy\u201d move - invading your neighbours is generally considered to be a Bad Thing.\nIn 1940 Germany went on to invade Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France. Again, \u201cinvading other countries\u201d sort of makes you the Bad Guy.\nThen, in 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the USSR, captured millions of prisoners of war, and basically just left them in empty fields surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards to starve or freeze to death (over a million Soviet POWs died in the winter of 1941/2) which is - once again - the sort of move associated with the Bad Guys.\nJapan, likewise, decided that if Nazi Germany could go invading everyone in sight, they could have some of that (on top of their long-running war in China they\u2019d been enjoying for a decade) so they invaded the Phillipines, Indonesia, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, French Indo-China (what\u2019s now Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia), Burma, and pushed all the way into India. As far as I can tell none of those nations were particularly eager to have been \u201cinvaded by Japan\u201d.\nThere was also the minor point that for a couple of years, as well as just letting Soviet POWs starve to death, the Nazis were happily working prisoners and slave labour from occupied countries to death in their factories on starvation rations, while also running industrial-scale extermination camps to kill off \u201cundesirables\u201d (Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, Communists, the disabled, anyone who didn\u2019t meet Nazi standards of perfection). Guess what? That\u2019s the sort of thing the villain does so the audience knows they\u2019re Really Bad.\nBasically, if Hitler had said at the start of September 1939 \u201cyou know what, let\u2019s not invade anybody\u201d then the Germany of that time would be remembered much more positively. But once you start fighting your way into other people\u2019s countries, firebombing their homes, and rounding up people for being the wrong religion or having the wrong politics and killing them en masse, you become pretty much the Bad Guy.\nTo pick on the US for just one example, it\u2019s fairly shameful the way they treated the Nisei (Japanese-American citizens) - they were rounded up, interned in camps, had their property confiscated or stolen. It was most definitely Not Good. But the Nisei weren\u2019t worked to death in factories on starvation rations, or shot or gassed on arrival at their internment camp/\nJapan and Germany started attacking other countries, and behaved notably worse than other nations in the way they treated their new conquests. (Note how nobody kicks off about Italian atrocities because - in WW2* - they avoided the worse horrors, despite the Italians being co-belligerents with Nazi Germany and Japan)\n*There were justified complaints about their use of chemical weapons in Africa in the 1930s, for instance, but the Italians avoided the sort of recreational cruelties that Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany indulged in during WW2.", "Is there a reason why German and Japan are viewed in such a bad way, as the villains of WW2, besides the fact that The Allies won? Could it be because history is always told by the winners as the right way that things should be?\nYes, there are reasons. Germany (not \u201cGerman\u201d) and Japan were truly the villains of WW II, and this attitude has nothing to do with who won. It has to do with who started hostilities, and how those nations conducted their wars.\nJapan initiated the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and this grew into the Pacific part of WW II. Their conduct of war in China was brutal beyond normal wartime behaviors. They killed large numbers of civilians including women and children, raped many Chinese women, performed wholly unethical and horrible medical experiments on prisoners including civilian prisoners, and were the aggressors. In December 1941 they extended their war to take on Great Britain and its Empire and Commonwealth, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the USA, all without any declaration of war. They violated what was considered by most of the world to be appropriate standards of conduct toward prisoners of war, using them for slave labor, killing many outright, starving many more, and employing torture, the afore-mentionsd medical experimentation, and other truly criminal acts. They deserve the label \u201cvillains\u201d\nOn the other side of the globe Germany was led by the totalitarian regime of the Nazi Party and its Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler. The Germans violated multiple treaties and agreements from 1935\u20131939, culminating in their invasion of Poland that precipitated the European part of WW II. The conduct of German forces during the war was highly variable, but often, and especially in the East, as criminal as that of the Japanese. They killed civilians as revenge for the killings by partisans/guerrillas of German soldiers in France, Belgium, and elsewhere. They terrorized civilian populations. Having started extreme measures against Jews, Roma, and other ethnic or religious groups in Germany before the war, they undertook what today we call the Holocaust, an industrialized form of murder intended to \u201csolve\u201d the \u201cJewish question\u201d by exterminating all the Jews of Europe. They generally treated prisoners of war from western nations well, but they broke all the rules in their treatment of Polish and Soviet prisoners of war, acting in ways very similar to how the Japanese treated POWS less selectively. They used them for slave labor, they killed many outright, they starved most, they tortured some, and in the concentration and death camps they also practiced medical experimentation on prisoners (men, women, and children, especially Jews). They are also appropriately labeled as \u201cvillains\u201d\nOf course had these villains won their wars they would have written their histories differently. However there were honorable Germans who did not approve or or participate in the war crimes of the Nazi regime, and who might have spoken out and written histories against it (had they been brave enough) after the war, particularly with regard to the extermination of the Jews and Roma. It is harder to assess, from this date, whether there were counterparts for those men and women in Japan. That does not change the facts, that what those nations did to start the wars and to carry them out violated normal rules of human behavior, that they acted barbarously, that they committed crimes.", "There are several reasons I'll list a few of the more well known ones just for the sake of argument. But this is far from a complete list.

The agitations involved several mass protests, riots, student and political movements majorly in Goa and Karnataka and concerned the official status of Konkani in the Indian Republic.\nAware of the looming danger of Konkani being sidelined, v\u0101man vard\u0113 \u015be\u1e47ai va\u1e37avalik\u0101r, popularly known as Shenoi goemb\u0101b gave a clarion call for the revival of Konkani in the early 20th century. Under his guidance, a steady movement was getting built up and the effort was on to initiate a rejuvenation of Konkani language and heritage, by means of establishing a common cultural identity among the Konkani people.\nThe root of the Konkani Language agitation laid in the denial of Konkani as an independent language and the opposition to merge Goa into Maharashtra. Konkani was not taken seriously as a potential official language except by a few stalwarts. By 1960, pro-Konkani and pro-Marathi groups started a propaganda war through distribution of pamphlets. In 1962, the All India Konkani Parishad held its eighth session for the first time at Ma\u1e0dg\u0101\u0303v (Margao) in post-liberation Goa and passed a resolution urging the Kendra Sahitya Akademi to recognise Konkani. Simultaneously, the referendum in 1967 thwarted the merger of Goa into Maharashtra and paved the way for its statehood in the Union of India. Goan statehood gave a further boost to the pro-Konkani camp.\nEarlier in 1966, the then Chief Minister of Goa, Dayanand Bandodkar appointed a committee to examine the feasibility of declaring Marathi as the official language of Goa. Attempts were made by some members of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, a party formed before the referendum proposing merger into Maharashtra, and a splinter group to pass a Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language Bill in 1966 which was thwarted by the Chief Minister. On 22 August 1970, Bandodkar declared Konkani, written in the Devanagari script, as the official language of Goa along with Marathi.\nIn 1973, chief minister of Goa, Dayanand Bandodkar died, and his daughter Shashikala Kakodkar ascended to the post. Under Kakodkar, government policies favouring Marathi were framed. Marathi was made compulsory in English medium schools whilst Konkani was excluded. This policy was met with severe criticism from Konkani organisations, both, within Goa and outside. Although promises were made by Kakodkar in 1977 and thereafter by then Congress Chief Minister Pratapsinh Rane in 1980 to treat Konkani at par with Marathi, the matter was kept in abeyance till 1986.\nIn their election manifesto, the Congress party had stated that once statehood was achieved Konkani would be recognised as an official language and demands would be made to include it in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. In 1980, the Congress came into power under Chief Minister Pratap Singh Rane, Rane despite the promises made, procrastinated on the issue. This led to an agitation in 1986 on the streets popularly called ko\u1e45ka\u1e47\u012b praj\u0113tso \u0101v\u0101z (voice of the Konkani people). Goa witnessed the bloodiest agitation ever, the Language agitation, in which seven pro-Konkani agitators lost their lives and several were injured. The government inorder to suppress the riot fired at the Pro-Konkani agitators.\nThe Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language bill, presented to the legislative assembly in 1986, was passed on 4 February 1987 declaring Konkani the sole official language of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu with provisions for Marathi and Gujarati for Daman and Diu. On 30 May 1987 Goa got statehood with Konkani as the sole official language. The Kendra Sahitya Academy recognised Konkani, in the Devanagari script, as an independent language on 26 February 1975. This paved the way for the decision to include Konkani in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution making Konkani one of the official languages of India.\nThe struggle for Konkani in Goa, did not go unnoticed in Canara and Travancore. The Konkani speakers in Canara (currently Uttara Kannada, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada) and Travancore (currently Cochin and Ernakulam), inspired by the writings of Shenoi Goembab were getting increasingly aware on the issue of mother tongue.(This shows the close relationship between Konkanis of Goa,Kerala and Karnataka)\nThe first public pro-Konkani gathering was held outside Goa and by non Goan Konkanis. In 1939, the All India Konkani Parishad was founded by the efforts of Manjunath Shanbhag and the first session was held. This was followed by the second session at Udupi organised by Dr. T.M.A. Pai. The liberation and subsequent statehood of Goa bolstered Konkani's status in Karnataka. In 1962, the Konkani Bhasha Prachar Sabha, Cochin, took up the issue of inclusion of Konkani in the Eighth schedule with the Government of India and the Linguistic Minorities Commission. In 1976, the Konkani Bhasha Mandali was founded at Mangalore enhance the status of Konkani in the state. In 1994, the Government of Karnataka founded the Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Academy at Mangalore to propagate Konkani literature. The first Vishwa Konkani Sammelan was held in Mangalore in 1995 wherein 5,000 delegated from 75 centres from India, the middle east, the US, UK, etc. participated.\nThe Konkani language agitations truly became successful when Konkani was included in the eight schedule of the Indian constitution in 1992.\nIn 2005, the foundation was laid for a World Konkani centre to further the cause of Konkani on a global scale. From the academic year 2007-2008 Konkani has become an optional subject in the schools of Karnataka and Kerala.\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f"], "topic_list": ["Konkani (language)", "Languages of India", "Language", "History"], "view_list": [91], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Shashank Shenoy (\u0936\u0936\u093e\u0902\u0915 \u0936\u0946\u0923\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0902)", "upvote_list": [12], "question_title": "What were the Konkani language agitations about, and what was the result of those agitations?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "185", "name_list": ["Shashank Shenoy (\u0936\u0936\u093e\u0902\u0915 \u0936\u0946\u0923\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0902)"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"]}, "587": {"ans_list": ["All I know is that it is/was located in California.", "Merce Cunningham - Wikipedia"], "topic_list": ["Photo Developing", "Companies", "History"], "view_list": [61, 1], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "C Hain", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "question_title": "What is the company history of Cunningham's Studios?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "261", "name_list": ["Rodney Dowling", "Roy Rutanen"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020"]}, "399": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Philippine Law", "History of the Philippines", "Jobs and Careers for Attorneys", "Politics of the Philippines", "Attorney Recommendations", "The Philippines", "Attorneys", "Legal Issues and Law in Everyday Life", "Law", "History"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "F.

Ironically the major European state without an emperor was now Italy.", "\u201cEmpire\u201d has a history attached to it. The name was coined by the Romans to describe a specific political arrangement. The empire was what the Romans had. It described their state and their political ambitions. In theory, everything was potentially subject to the empire. They just hadn\u2019t taken control of it yet (and, of course, they\u2019d forebear to take control of places they couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t feel like conquering and would negotiate with whoever lived there). Other things we call empires, like the various Persian states, the Romans didn\u2019t call empires, because they weren\u2019t the empire.\nWhen Roman control over western Europe collapsed and the line of emperors ended there, that opened the door for things to become more generic. In the late 7th century, the ruler of the Bulgars was awarded the imperial title of Caesar by the Byzantine empire, which opened the door to call the territory of the Bulgars an empire. In 800 AD, Charlemagne was crowned emperor by the Pope, reviving the idea of a line of supreme rulers operating under Roman legal precedent. That title vanished again some decades later but surfaced again as the Holy Roman Empire started to come together. Serbs, Russians, French, and even British rulers eventually adopted it. What happened is that the name became less and less an indication of Roman legal and political heritage and more and more a statement of comprehensive rule over many nations.\nSo, then, it became acceptable for some power which happened to be European to call themselves an empire as soon as they invented the idea.

Brown of Georgia said, \u201cThe Conscription Act at one fell swoop, strikes down the sovereignty of the states, tramples upon the constitutional rights and personal liberty of the citizens, and arms the President with imperial power.\u201d There were no conscription riots in the Confederacy I am aware of.", "There were little draft dodger communities in isolated mountains or swamps, on the edge of towns. Friends or relatives would bring out food and other necessities. Youngsters near draftable age would escape to these. By the mid point in the war, they knew that going to the military was a near death sentence.\nSome of these little enclaves were so dangerous, that even law enforcement was leery of going after. By the end of the war, there were some 100,000 that were dodging the draft or AWOL.\nTurns out war wasn\u2019t really so fun after all. Who knew??", "As far as I know there were no anti-draft riots in the southern states during the Civil War. There definitely were food riots, the most notorious of which occurred in the capital, Richmond, and Jefferson Davis was actually confronted by some of the protesting women. Those women broke into bakeries and store houses during the riot.\nIn addition to the other forms of resistance to the draft mentioned in other answers, some state governors refused requests for troops. The most famous of these was Governor Brown of Georgia, who kept some Georgia regiments in-state and refused to allow them to go north to fight with Lee. Under the strict States\u2019 Rights CSA Constitution, he got away with this (until W T Sherman came along and made the point moot).", "Draftees violently resisted conscription officers of the Confederate government; I don\u2019t know that they gathered into a \u201criot\u201d which suggests crowds.", "Question: \u201cDuring the American Civil War, was there instances of conscription riots in the Confederacy similar to the New York Draft Riots in the Union?\u201d\nDraft Riot is a misnomer which does not properly describe what happened. For three days in July of 1863 Irish immigrants from the crime ridden Five-Points District engaged in an orgy of shootings, beatings, murder and arson directed at Negroes. Although the catalyst for the riot was the desire of the Irish to avoid military service in the Civil War (while continuing to enjoy both access to American citizenship and the prosperity induced by the war), the primary cause was extreme racial hostility.\nThe Irishmen viscerally hated Blacks. They regarded Free Negroes as a threat to their jobs as unskilled laborers. Moreover, the only people possibly socially and economically below Irishmen in the American social hierarchy were the Free Negroes. And the Irish wanted them to stay there. The Irish despised the idea of the racial equality. If the Irish could not climb up the social ladder they at least desired to kick someone off the rung below them! And they were not going to fight in any war that would free Negro slaves and make them equal to Irishmen.\nThis Irish Race Riot resulted in the murder by hanging (often accompanied by vicious beating, shooting, and mutilation with knives) of eleven Negroes, one of which was an eleven year old child. Fifty buildings were burnt to the ground, including the occupied Colored Children\u2019s Orphan Asylum. The mob set fire to many black homes which the Irish looted before setting fire to them. As many as 2,000 people may have been killed and 8,000 injured. Three-thousand Blacks were made homeless. But the lasting result was racial cleansing, the removal of all Negroes from the now Irish dominated Five-Points slum district.\nThere were Southern riots by poor women who were trying to protect their husbands, often deserters, from capture by militia hunters. Poor Southern women also violently resisted the confiscation of their crops and food by self-appointed militias. (Note that those militia gangs who hunted down women\u2019s husbands and raided farms and confiscated the crops and food from near starving women and children conveniently made themselves exempt from real military service.) But Southerners also resisted the Civil War Draft by other means.\nFirst of all those Southerners with influence bribed legislatures to exempt either their class or their occupation from military service. For example, any man who owned 20 slaves, i.e. was of the class that would benefit from a war for the preservation and expansion of slavery, was automatically exempt from serving in that war. This exemption was taken advantage of by the planter class who divided their lands and slave holdings into parcels with 20 slaves each. If one owned 100 slaves (Some planters owned over 1,000.) this legal trick then permitted five sons (or anyone else to whom one could sell the exemption) to avoid military service in the Confederacy.\nSome states had special interest exemptions. Georgia, for example, passed a law that for some reason exempted owners of drug stores from military service. This persuaded peddlers to sell kits containing a small number of combs and scissors and a few bottles of patent medicine to Southern draft dodgers who then, with their meager supplies and a shop front, proclaimed themselves to be druggists. Shabby drug stores popped up all over Georgia.\nBut some Southerners went way beyond draft dodging or bribing legislatures. They murdered military recruiters or militia members searching for deserters. Many poor farmers in Georgia knew the Civil War for what it was, a \u201crich man\u2019s war\u201d, promoted by and for the benefit of the rich planter class. Many refused to join the Confederate Army, many more, often having been begged to do so by their wives, deserted. There were counties in the mountains of northern Georgia and in the wire grass south of the state occupied by gangs if deserters. In those counties Confederate Recruiters or those hunting down deserters were bushwhacked and shot or hung. There were during the Civil War parts of Georgia and western Virginia where Confederate Recruiters feared to go.\nNote re the draft: The New York board of Supervisors paid for substitutes for any city policemen, firemen, or poor men with dependents. So when after the riots ended and the draft resumed the New York Sun reported that, through September 28, 1863, 1,042 drafted men provided substitutes, 49 paid the $300 exemption fee, and many men from the Five-Points district were rejected as physically, mentally, or morally unfit for military service. Only 2 Irishmen joined the Union Army. Both deserted.", "They didn\u2019t have to riot with the inactment of the \"Twenty Negro Law\", also known as the \"Twenty Slave Law.\u201d Basically, the Confederate Congress passed a law which specifically exempted one white man for every twenty slaves owned on a Confederate plantation. To further aid slave owners and their cohorts, and to keep slaves in check, the law also allowed military service exemptions for two or more plantations within five miles of each other that collectively had twenty or more slaves. This allowed the slave owners to subdivide their plantations into many smaller ones. Whereas, their sons and nephews then became overseers - Avoiding the draft.\n[", "No, the reason for the riots in the north was that they knew Lincoln was wrong. The reason there were no riots in the south is the Southerners knew the north and Lincoln was Attacking them unconstitutionally.", "Resistance in the South took other forms. The only riots I am aware of had to do with food rather than conscription.\nFood was a problem that only grew as the war went on. Confederate money, became worthless, prices for foodstuffs soared, and the poor people in the South started skipping meals.\nWomen in Richmond Virginia rioted over food in 1864.\nThe first and very well known instance of resistance was the slave population. Those that could ran away, costing their owners lots of money. Many ended up joining the Union Army. The total number was around 185,000 soldiers. That was larger than an entire Field Army at the time.\nSome that stayed became spies. Others ran away when the Union Forces neared their location. (Thank You Russell Pearson for pointing out my mistake.)\nHow a Black Spy Infiltrated the Confederate White House\nAn absolutely fascinating account of a Southern White woman, who was an abolitionist and a Black Freed woman, who worked her way into becoming a servant at the Confederate White House. She helped POW\u2019s escape from Libby prison, and she spied there, as well for a time.\nThe answer to your question is there were surprisingly large parts of the South that were hostile to the cause. The story of the \u201cKingdom of Jones\u201d has become well known through a movie called \u201cFree State.\u201d\nIn fact, besides the border states like Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and West Virginia, there were quite large portions of North Carolina, and Tennessee, that were pro union, and anti Confederate from the start. Its a well known fact that every southern state , except South Carolina, the young men voted with their feet, ran away north, and enlisted in the Union Army."], "topic_list": ["Military Conscription", "Riots", "Historical Civil Wars", "U.S. Civil War", "History of the United States of America", "Military History and Wars", "History", "The United States of America"], "view_list": [23, 37, 50, 11, 289, 27, 29, 644], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Thomas Tarnorng Sawyer", "upvote_list": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 6], "question_title": "During the American Civil War, was there instances of conscription riots in the Confederacy similar to the New York Draft Riots in the Union?", "respond_collected": 8, "no_of_view": "1,869", "name_list": ["Chris Flaherty", "Gene Hennig", "Douglas C.

The key to that strategy would be to get out of their way, and feed them whatever you can send.\nThe Battle of the Bulge and various German counter attacks on the soviets such as Operation Citedal forced the German army into costly operations that overextended their lines, reduced combat efficiency, and permanently reduced their ability to conduct a fighting defense.\nThe German officer corp if left to their won devices could have prolonged the fighting strategic withdrawal for months.\nThe key word being \u2018prolong\u2019.

You have no choice but to draw.\nIt also bears mentioning that in hindsight we can know that the allies had the Manhattan Project as their ace in the hole. Any prolonging of the war would have meant that Germany is the one who gets the visit from a Fat Man and a Little Boy. So, no, you don't want to prolong the fighting.\nThe best strategy would have been to choose who to lose to. I would have recommended the Germans evacuate as many civilians and industrial inventory from the East, and throw almost everything at the Russians, in the forelorn hope of keeping them out of Germany and Eastern Europe. What the Russians occupy is given to them by the Allies. That will be the final FU to Stalin that makes the Soviets look foolish and weak for the future.\nAs for the west, is say the Germans can try to drive a wedge into their inevitable conquerors. I might recommend prioritizing losses to the French, and other national resistance groups, then the British, and only then the Americans. This will change the narrative of the future. The Europeans will paper over the American contribution just as they did after World War 1. The French will pride themselves on avenging their honor with help from no one else, the British will think themselves superior to the Americans, and the Yankees get upset and go back to being isolationist for lack of gratitude.\nThat is an unlikely end result, but at least attempting to do so will end up.with Western powers occupying more of the German territories rather than the Soviets.\nFinally, diplomatically, the Germans need to swallow their pride totally and pucker up and try to beg Truman for that sweet sweet Marshal Plan money. If necessary, set up a Pro-American fifth column of German Christian Democrats to 'betray' their country.

The Egyptian Pyramids and the Stonehenge are dated around the 3rd millenia and the Mesopotamian ziggurats are in between them.\nNow, let\u2019s imagine we are in a Neolithic tribe and we want to make something special to honor our Deities or Nature or a compination of them.

All we have is our strength and tenacity and these are what we offer by making a huge structure that requires 100% of our abilities.\nSo, plain Neolithic persistent people had built them.\nAs the civilization progress, the need of megastructures decline.

Because all the structures that weren't made of rock have been worn away by time, errosion, nature, fires, and people scavenging building materials over millenea, so that only the structures made of worthless stone remain. If we could see even a tenth of what used to be around those 'megaliths' we wouldn't be anywhere near so impressed by the rock show.\nLet's also forget the type of rock, which varies constantly. The construction materials matter much more. Stonehenge uses huge monoliths, where as the pyramids are made of blocks cut into different shapes, originally capped by smooth limestone, and South American structures are made in Cyclopean style, of uncut stones painstakingly fitted together.\nSo the answer to \u201cwho built the structures?\u201d is lots, and lists of different people at different times using different tools, for completely different purposes.", "Humans.\nnot aliens of any type, or gods.

While not all the delegates to the Constitutional Convention were Brothers, they were all certainly influenced by Masonic values. First and foremost was the overarching principle of creating a nation of LAWS and not of men, sustained by an ingenious and unique arrangement of centralized and decentralized authority, mixed with a separation of powers. Behold a partial list of Masonic principles:\nThe grand lodge is supreme in the Masonic federal system\nLocal lodges are self-governing and independent\nThe selection of officers is carried out by secret vote using a ballot and elections\nGovernance is limited by the Constitution\nThe popular sovereignty of representative government and majority rule are fundamental\nFiscal responsibility is delegated to the legislative body\nA type of judicial review is conducted by the grand lodge\nFreedoms of speech and equal participation are hallmarks of Freemasonry\nJust as a Masonic Lodge lives and dies by its Grand Lodge\u2019s Charter and its own By-Laws, the USA was to operate within the parameters of its Constitutional (both federal and state) limitations.\nAnother couple of Masonic virtues that made it into our founding values - equality before the law, and equality with each other regardless of position. In a Masonic Lodge, all Brothers are equal - from the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge to the uninvolved sideliner who does nothing more than attend meetings, a Brother is a Brother is a Brother. That holds whether he\u2019s visiting from another city, state, country, or planet (yes, there is a Lodge on the Moon). Also, there is no \u201cnobility\u201d in Masonry. There are no inherited positions or titles. Office holders have to be elected by a one-man one-vote election, and those elected are vested with carrying out the responsibilities of their position and nothing more. They receive the thanks of their Brethren for their service, but no further \u2018elevation\u2019 takes place. There are no special box seats for Past Grand Masters and Worshipful Masters - they retain their form of address, but they sit alongside everybody else. When balloting, they get one vote like everybody else. There are no Masonic aristocrats or commoners. Just Brothers.\nWas the American revolution a Masonic Revolt? Considering that many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were Brothers, and that the Commander in Chief George Washington and 33 of the Continental Army\u2019s Major Generals were Masons, as were the French commanders serving with us - Admirals D\u2019Estaing and de Grasse, and General Rochambeau, as well as most of the European volunteers that served - Baron von Steuben, the Marquis de Lafayette, and others, as well as our first naval commander - John Paul Jones, and that we fought to enshrine in our new nation the Masonic values they all held dear, it\u2019s not a stretch to say that it was.\nAfter the Revolution, we exported out values to the rest of our hemisphere, where other Masons - Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, General Simon Bolivar, and General Jose de San Martin went about their own revolutions against autocracy and colonialism. When the Empire struck back with the French occupation of Mexico, Brother Benito Juarez went about that country\u2019s second liberation. The Texas Revolution against the tyranny of Santa Anna (who had demitted his membership) was led by Masons - the Colonels who commanded the Alamo - Crocket, Travis and Bowie were all Masons, as were Austin, and Houston - the victor of the battle of San Jacinto.\nElsewhere, while the French Revolution was not begun by Masons, fully one-third of the National Assembly were Brethren.

I do not know \u201cwho traded myrrh in 1 BCE?\u201c It was apparently considered to be very valuable.\nMYRRH\nAn aromatic gum resin. (Ca 1:13;\n4:6,\n14;\n5:1,\n13\n) Its precise source in ancient times is uncertain. But generally myrrh is the resin obtained from various thorny shrubs or small trees of the genus Commiphora, such as Commiphora myrrha or Commiphora abyssinica. These shrubs thrive in rocky areas, particularly on limestone hills. Their wood and bark have a strong odor. Although the resin exudes by itself from the stem or from the thick and stiff branches of either variety, the flow can be increased by means of incisions. Initially the resin is soft and sticky but, upon dripping to the ground, it hardens.\nMyrrh was one of the ingredients for the holy anointing oil. (Ex 30:23-25\n) Esteemed for its fragrance, it was used to scent garments, beds, and other items. (Compare Ps 45:8;\nPr 7:17;\nCa 3:6, 7\n.) The Shulammite maiden of The Song of Solomon appears to have applied liquid myrrh to her body before retiring for the night. (Ca 5:2,\n5\n) Massages with oil of myrrh were included in the special beauty treatment given to Esther. (Es 2:12\n) Myrrh was also one of the substances employed in preparing bodies for burial. (Joh 19:39, 40\n) It was apparently viewed as having sufficient value to be presented as a gift to one born king of the Jews.\u2014Mt 2:1, 2,\n11\n.\nTo research any Bible topic, click here", "Anyone who get hold of it.\nMyrrh was a very valuable product in the Roman Empire and very expensive as well. It had multiple uses including medicinal and fragrances.\nBut I suspect you asked about 1BCE because you want to connect it to Jesus Christ. Well first of all if he was born at all it wasn\u2019t in 1BCE or 1CE it was probably no later than 5BCE. But even then Myrrh was widely traded. But the idea of anyone giving Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh, three very valuable products, to a baby born in a barn of poor parents is fanciful at best.\nThe idea that three kings travelled just to see this child is ludicrous and that alone is nuts. Have you any idea of how many people would have travelled with even one King? It would be hundreds so for three it would be thousands. Indeed such a delegation would have been refused by Herod simply because of the cost it would have incurred. Kings visiting other Kings was a very rare event because it was so expensive and presented a threat to the host, imagine thousands of troops traipsing through an enemy territory it doesn\u2019t bare thinking about. When Caesar vested Egypt to hook up with Cleopatra he went with 2 legions and 800 cavalry just in case which proved too few when his visit was repulsed. A visit by one King unannounced would have been taken as a threat, a visit by three would have been regarded as an invasion.\nLike so many stories in the Bible when you break them down they fall flat as the paper they are written on.", "At least one of the three wise men!"], "topic_list": ["BCE/CE", "Commodities Trading", "Trade", "Ancient History", "History"], "view_list": [3, 37, 1], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Rose Biss", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "question_title": "Who traded myrrh in 1 BCE?", "respond_collected": 3, "no_of_view": "135", "name_list": ["Randall Fields", "Mike Organ", "Kenneth Boggs"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020"]}, "505": {"ans_list": ["It was the era of my teens and twenties growing up after graduating from high school in 1965.

Lots of protests were going on back then and some were into drugs and the music was great in Motown.

It was a great time I wont forget.", "Later on inspired by the political environment and a dissatisfaction with the Vietnam war and the civil rights movement for change made for incredible music and a belief that music could change the world all rather inspiring for those who seized the opportunity to make their wishes known.", "I have to say some of the answers already posted seem like a load of cant as usual. That\u2019s the trouble with cant - it\u2019s largely ill informed and poorly cited or researched. I am not a cant ( peddler ) I like frankness and almost brutal detail.\nI have read a range of books on this era and also read a lot of History and Sociology generally. One of the most interesting books White Heat by Dominic Sandbrook is very insightful on this. He explodes some of the myths that people create about the 1960s in the UK!\nIt was generally a very small strata of Metro centric individuals in Pop/Rock and Creative industries like Film or possibly even Drama who took any drugs. Sure there were examples of heroin users and coke addicts ( long before the current crop of Tory Ministers) but again these existed among the Elite.\nThe most widely publicised drug consumption was when the Beatles openly admitted taking Acid. They were also widely known for their \u2018 smoking \u2018 too. Others in the music industry aped them and Keith Richards used these as a gateway to becoming a full blown Junkie.\nHowever the vast vast majority of people in Britain or Ireland had no experience of drugs. First and foremost there was no industrial size production like there is now. People grow and manufacture drugs in their home environment nowadays.\nMost of the population in the 1960s were way way too \u2018 Square \u2018. The majority of substance abuse was alcohol and tobacco and probably a bit of legally prescribed Valium. The damage caused by alcohol and tobacco were horrific. In terms of Society and Health economics too.\nSo this utter bile that the population all got turned on to Acid is pure shite to be honest.\nIf anyone was likely to \u2018 experiment \u2018 it was the young largely well educated and mostly very middle class. And again I suspect that was Metro centric too.\nI was 13/14 by the end of the Sixties growing up in a Glasgow Housing Scheme. I was reasonably fortunate that my Father had one small business and access to another small Family shop too. We always had a car a phone things like TVs and record players plus went on a more than decent holiday once a year. Most people I grew up with had perhaps one of those \u2018 luxuries \u2018 but not all. Mainly tv it had to be said. I think that lack of affluence would be similar in most parts of Glasgow and certainly large industrial areas in England.\nOf course in London in the more privileged and elite locations then some people had all those signs of affluence and more. Possibly a premium brand of car or even a colour TV and a stereo record player and trips to America. They seemed like the Emperors of Rome or something. We were grunts or slaves by comparison.\nThe common people were also very ignorant and poorly educated by today\u2019s standards. They were also very very Reactionary and there were lots of Moral Panics whipped up by an unpleasant National Press. Don\u2019t forget hanging had only just been abolished in the 1960s. Most people still supported it and other forms of severe corporal punishment such as birching and caning. The mindset of most ordinary people was actually quite abusive. Parents didn\u2019t object if their small child was caned by an Adult teacher ( who you dread to think may have drawn some perverse enjoyment from it ).\nHomosexuality was legalised but poof queer arsehole bandit were common gay slurs. Most gay people were still ostracised and marginalised and frequently harassed by the Police. The Peelers were oppressive Racist Sectarian and homophobic. They also used to fit people up and force confessions as well as \u2018 coerce \u2018 witnesses. Many Police Officers took bribes drank on duty or looted places that had already been broken into. No one stopped them.\nI grew up in Glasgow but my Family remained rooted in Northern Ireland. The Police in Northern Ireland were used as a Paramilitary type force to oppress Catholics / Nationalists/Republicans and were capable of inciting riots or Pogroms to allow Loyalists free hand to damage Catholics and Catholic property.\nIt was in the 1960s a Loyalist group started murdering Catholics and bombing Property with the Collusion of the Police and State. They victimised Catholics to put them \u2018 in their place \u2018. Slowly but surely matters escalated until the place exploded in the 1960s. This resulted in a quasi Civil War that killed and maimed Citizens Army Police Paramilitaries Politicians and gave rise to vicious murderous Loyalist gangs the Shankill Butchers and Glenanne Gang.\nOn a wider Global stage the horrors of the Vietnam War took hold with probably Millions killed ( and no one really knows ). The earliest foundations of the Genocidal Khmer Rouge started in adjacent Cambodia as a reaction to USA carpet bombing.\nReverting back to UK and Ireland the vilest criminals existed and perpetrated vile crimes.?There were the Moors Murderers and murderous Gangs like the Krays and The Richardsons. In Glasgow where I was growing up the Street gangs were also murdering and maiming people too.\nSo when I read it was \u2018 The Dawning of The Age of Aquarius \u2018 I almost want to throw up. It\u2019s not \u2018 The Summer of Love \u2018 or \u2018 All You Need Is Love \u2018 for most people. Talk of the Pill is also ridiculous. And Abortion only became legal in 1967. The vast majority were total reactionaries and very unsupportive labelling it \u2018 Free Love \u2018 and just constantly whinging about the permissive society!!", "Great people! I was one of them.", "Since I was a youth of the 60\u2019s, I can tell you it was a most wonderful time in my life.\nI was in high school and loving the music of the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Chicago, The \u201cBritish Invasion\u201d music artists.\nMost of us where embarking on either our first job or, college.\nIt was also a time of Woodstock, Vietnam,the assassination of John & Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King & Medgar Evers, who was so shockingly shot down in front of his wife and children as he exited his vehicle in his driveway.\nThe tragedy of losing one of our own young men, Joe Giles, in Vietnam, was beyond devastating, as he was a much loved son, brother and friend and the first fatality in our city.\nSegregation was still at the forefront of the news and the youth of the 60\u2019s saw many horrible events that would be a stain forever embedded on the pages of history.\nWithout a doubt there was a large population of yout in the 60\u2019s that experienced unspeakable pain and suffering because of their living situations.\nMy thoughts and perspective on the youth of the 60\u2019s most likely just scratches the surface of that time in our lives.

As I recall from having read what Goethe had to say about it, at one point the conversation came around to Goethe\u2019s Werther, which Napol\u00e9on apparently had read closely, and voiced some reservations that one passage in the book was \u201cnot natural,\u201d which Goethe conceded, but claimed the right of a writer\u2019s license for poetic artifice. This was apparently the meeting where Napol\u00e9on is supposed to have said, \u201cLe destin, c\u2019est la politique\u201d as reported by Goethe.\nLater, on 6 October 1808, Napol\u00e9on met Goethe and Wieland in Weimar, but there are no details about their conversation from Goethe. (Apparently, Wieland wrote something about it after the fact, but Goethe did not.) About a week later (14 October 1808), Napol\u00e9on awarded both the Cross of the Legion of Honour.\nIncidentally, the meeting between Goethe and Napol\u00e9on occurs as a sort of flashback in Thomas Mann\u2019s novel Lotte in Weimar. It is not precisely a mystery.\nGoethe was probably at that time the most famous literary figure in Europe, and his work \u2014 particularly Werther \u2014 were enormously popular and influential. Wieland was German literature\u2019s elder statesman, and well-known and regarded in his own right; he wrote the Bildungsroman Geschichte des Agathon and the play Oberon, both of which were popular. At one point, Napol\u00e9on called Wieland \u201cThe German Voltaire.\u201d\nI am not sure what the point of this question was. It was not at all unusual to be a fan of Goethe back in the day, and it crossed international boundaries. And Napol\u00e9on was an intelligent fellow, and pretty well-educated and interested in many things. In addition, Napol\u00e9on was not unaware of the public relations benefits to be obtained to have himself seen as being on good terms with the giants of German literature. I am not saying he was uninterested in meeting them, but it\u2019s a mistake to think of Napol\u00e9on as a fan. Think of everything he did as partly politically-motivated.\nSo my summary answer to the querent\u2019s question is, \u201cYeah, so what?\u201d\nAs Emperor, Napol\u00e9on met and spoke with a lot of people of cultural, artistic, and scientific importance.

In most cases, they used similar equipment to the main army.\nMiniArt 1/16 Praetorian Guardsman\nMy answer to Is there any record of what regular legionnaires in the Roman army thought about the Praetorian guard? includes a quote from the Rhine Muntineers:\nDo the Praetorian cohorts, which have just got their two denarii per man, and who after 16 years are restored to their homes, encounter more perils? We do not disparage the guards of the capital; still, here amid barbarous tribes we have to face the enemy from our tents.\nAs you can see, the regular army in the early empire had a rather low opinion of the Praetorian Guard [Matyszak, 2011, p47].\nHere are the people who kept Rome safe (or at least less unsafe):\nRoman Vigiles with a thief. Vigile along with the many other guard forces employed by the emperor's, including Prea\u2026 | Roman and Byzantine Civilization | Ancient rome, Ancient pompeii, Classical antiquity\nIn fact, the Guard were a bunch of troublemakers. According to Philip Matyszak (who as you can see wrote two of the sources I\u2019m using), the Guard had a poor reputation when it was a respectable military unit in 14, but by 200 it seems the people of Rome saw them as breakers of law rather than enforcers, not to mention useless at a military role, but the Urban Cohorts and the Vigiles still had the confidence of the public. Indeed, the Urban Cohorts protected the people from the Guard when Commodus ordered them to attack the citizens. [Matyszak, 2007, pp71\u201374].\nEven so, the early emperors did not have the Guard protect them closely. Emperors until Galba had Germans protect them as they had no political loyalties to anyone else in Rome. However, Galba did not trust them, so disbanded them [Webster, 1985, pp101\u2013102].\nQuora user Jeffrey Dubiel had the right idea about the Praetorians\u2019 special status:\nI see things haven\u2019t changed much. Those closest to the boss, in this case the emperor, get the goodies, while those at the tip of the spear also get the shaft as well.\nAnd as I said:\nIndeed. Of course, those closest to the boss are the ones most capable of stabbing the boss to death\u2026\nIn terms of equipment, the Guard often had the same weapons and armour as everyone else, though received new developments first. Things changed in the 3rd century when they received ceremonial scale armour [Barker 1981, pp63\u201365].\nHowever, your question has raised an interesting point. Was there a force within the Roman army comparable to modern special forces? Who would be the SAS or SEALs of the classical world? I\u2019ve looked around and the definitions I\u2019ve found for special forces are units that perform special operations (very helpful, I know). Special operations are tasks that normal soldiers would not normally do, are extremely intense, or don\u2019t follow the usual rulebook. It is not enough to simply be better than everyone else, there has to be a special role.\nIn terms of units that performed special tasks, the Romans in the Dacian Wars had special units designed to take out enemy falxmen or more likely were the only ones lucky enough to receive the new equipment. Falxes were vicious weapons that could cut through anything unarmoured, so the natural response was to give certain soldiers more armour [Ibid, p64] [Matyszak, 2011, pp108\u2013109].\nDacian Shield and Sword ~ The Dacian Wars\nAndrea Miniatures: Classics In 90MM - Roman Legionary, Darcian Wars, 101-102 AD\nThe toruble is that everyone I can think of turns out to be elite at best rather than special. Roman auxiliaries who engaged in low-intensity warfare or scouting were simply doing what armies had done for a long time, well within the bounds of convention. The cataphracts in the later army were just doing what the enemy had done as part of conventional tactics.\nHowever, there may be a group of people who could be considered Roman special forces. I only found one source for them, Phil Barker\u2019s source from 1981, but they sound good. In what Phil Barker calls the 2nd and 3rd Century Modifications, Vegetius said that the Legions now had light infantry integrated into their ranks.\nEarlier, Barker says that Arrian is his contemporary text Order of Battle Against the Alans mentioned legion light infantry, that there was a figure on Trajan\u2019s Column who could represent them, and that they seemed to fit the existing legion organisation rather than be in addition to those already there.\nThere are also sources that there was a group called the Lanciarii who may have used the cavalry Lancea spear and wore less armour. The Lancea was a light spear better at thrusting than the pilum. It seems that Lanciarii. Whatever the case, Lanciarii often worked on independent missions, though Barker has not provided any examples. However, he does say that Ammianus and Vegetius mentioned groups called the Ferentarii and Exculcatores who darted out of a legion's ranks to pursue the enemy [Barker, 1981, pp10\u201312, 70].\nI\u2019ve found a mention of them in the Battles of Antioch and Adrianople, though the source for Adrianople says that by 378 they were no longer the original light infantry [Jacobsen, 2017].

Two world Wars and the American desire for free trade.\nIn 1914 there is little argument that Great Britain dominated global finances, Britain\u2019s main allies in the war France and Russia were more or less unable to pay the full costs of the war and Britain was forced to aid them financially unsurprisingly Britain, came out of World War One with a mountain of debt.\nGiven a significant period of peace its likely that Great Britain would have recovered, but as World War Two broke out in 1939 that recovery simply hadn\u2019t happened and Britains financial situation got worsened, this situation was exacerbated by the fact that almost all of Great Britain's war debt was held by the United States.\nIt is important to understand that an empire is rarely financially viable, the costs of running an empire are significant and it those costs get greater the larger it is. The British Empire was rarely planned, much of the expansion was driven at the periphery rather than by any government decision, so prudent financial decisions as to whether the expansion was sensible rarely factored into its growth. The British Empire\u2019s continued survival was based on Britain\u2019s ability to maintain closed and captive markets, this meant parts of the empire could only buy and sell from Britain or other parts of the empire (typically with Britain as the middle man getting a cut) and at prices dictated by Britain.\nSo India might be made to produce cotton which it could only sell to Great Britain at what would be lower than the market price, Cotton mills in Great Britain would then create clothing cheaply with subsidised cotton and then sell those clothes back to the rest of the empire (including India) at controlled and inflated prices. America might have cheaper clothes to sell but as the British empire was largely a closed market American industry would simply not be allowed to sell its products there.\nOne of America\u2019s post-war conditions to Great Britain as her principal debt holder and financier (Britain by 1945 was nearly bankrupt, so reliant on US loans) was that these closed markets be opened up, as a result, the Empire became a financial burden on Great Britain rather than a financial engine at which point its days were numbered.", "I would only opine that there may be greater glory now, when not ruling others against their consent.", "The British Empire was once the greatest empire to ever have existed, but now it is a shadow of its former glory. What were the most important factors in the empires decline? Were they forced, or was it their own doing which caused it?\nSo much is wrong with this question.\nNeither. The conditions that allowed the British Empire to exist changed, so it ceased to exist. This is what has happened to every empire that has ended and, hopefully, will happen to those that still exist.", "World War 1 started the countdown, but Britain had been losing strength starting in the late 19th century.\nThe Dominions\nThe Dominions were the first to go for the exits. They won, in a series of Imperial Conferences\n, de facto independence from the Empire. The Balfour Declaration of 1926\nand later Statute of Westminster 1931\nsealed the deal and also killed the last gasp for British control over the Dominions in the Imperial Federation\nidea.\nThey would all (except Ireland) still fight for Britain occasionally, most importantly in the Second World War, but after that it was over. With the exception of South Africa, all of the Dominions got swept into the American sphere of influence after WW2.\nEconomic Competition\nThere\u2019s also the fact that starting in the late 19th century, British commercial and industrial dominance was being challenged everywhere, but especially by America and Germany. The temporary block against Germany after WW1 simply expanded America\u2019s economic reach around the world -it did no real economic favors for Britain. Indeed, British assets around the world were liquidated to pay for that war, assets which the Americans scooped up on the cheap. WW2 accelerated that trend.\nIn addition, Britain had started losing its industrial edge by the 1870s. The US economy overtook Britain\u2019s around that time, while the unification of Germany created a new industrial powerhouse -not to mention the other powers that were industrializing at a rapid clip, particularly Russia and Japan.\nGeopolitical Competition\nIn the early to mid 19th Century, Britain could more or less do what they wanted globally with little competition. Everyone else was recovering from the Napoleonic Wars, or was no threat at all.\nBy the late 19th, that had ended. North America and the Caribbean were essentially Washington\u2019s playground by the end of the Spanish-American War, and Britain often made concessions on this front to America. In Central Asia, Britain found itself engaged in the \u201cGreat Game\u201d with Russia, while in Africa Britain found itself at odds with its old foe France. In East Asia Japan was a rising power that couldn\u2019t be ignored, while of course, in Europe, there was Germany.\nThat Germany ended up being the mortal threat is often taken for granted as inevitable today, but it could\u2019ve been either of these powers or a combination of them. Indeed, Japan would be just that in WW2 to an extent, and it was America in the end that basically absorbed the Empire. The important thing is that Britain was facing lots of threats from around the world, often at similar times, and unlike the post-Napoleonic Wars era it wasn\u2019t a sure bet that Britain could head them off.\nA Much Weaker Empire\nThe British Empire going into World War 2 was a far more decentralized, poorer, overstretched entity than it was at any time prior. There was basically no way such an entity could survive that war.\nBut even pre-World War 1 the British Empire was already being challenged across the world across all fronts -technological, military, geopolitical. It was able to head off most of these challenges using skillful diplomacy -ceding primacy in the Americas and Caribbean to the USA, containing (and then allying with) France and Russia, allying with Japan. It was very close, with very fast footwork, but it worked.\nThere was just one power left to negotiate with, and then Britain could enjoy an empire on which the sun would never set.\nUnfortunately, that one remaining power was Germany, a militaristic revisionist power that desperately wanted its own place in the sun.\nThe First World War knocked Germany down a peg, but Britain was practically made bankrupt by fighting it. After this war the Empire started to slowly drift apart, starting with the Dominions, though no one really realized it yet. The economy was moribund. The colonized people -especially India and Ireland- were restless; Ireland even got out entirely. Egypt had to be spun off (although still under tight British influence). The empire was fading but as most of the world was doing much, much worse, few really took note.\nUntested Weakness\nThe only reason it survived up to the middle of the 20th century is because up until 1939 no one challenged it. British warplanners, for example, noted in 1924 that the absolute best case scenario for a war against the United States would be a stalemate, and even there they realized they couldn\u2019t defend Canada, stalemate or no.\nWhen Britain was actually threatened by strong powers (Germany, Japan) they basically collapsed and had to be bailed out (in the military and economic sense) by the USA. The Empire simply had nothing left in the tank by 1939. They could defend, yes, but only the Home Islands and parts of Africa. Everything else was basically on its own -in fact resources were stripped from elsewhere for exactly this purpose, further driving away the Dominions. In fact Australia had to break with Britain over this policy and force the recall of their troops back home against British insistence, yet another nail in the Imperial coffin. The interests of the Dominions and Britain were diverging. Britain could no longer defend them.\nAmerican loans and supply (and eventually direct military support) propped up the Empire throughout the war, while the German struggle against the USSR took off some pressure. In East Asia the British basically had to cede the entire war theater to the Americans.\nPostwar reflected this reality, as the UK and its dominions were swept into the American sphere of influence -the cost of the bailout. The Suez Crisis\nand Britain\u2019s humiliation in that crisis was simply the new geopolitical reality made visible for all to see. Now the UK and its former Dominions (bar South Africa and Ireland) are tied into American military and intelligence networks, like Five Eyes.\nWas it Britain\u2019s own doing?\nNot really. Well, you can point to bad decisions they made sure, but when it comes down to it no empire is eternal. It was less about Britain and more that it was time for sunset.\nEveryone thinks they\u2019ll sit on the throne forever.", "You will find that you can google the answer to this!!", "This has been answered so many times.

There were 2 levels of the British Empire when I was a small boy. The self governing dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and the rest which were mainly colonies at a lower level.

The classic examples were Ireland and India.", "This is established history and has also been answered well on Quora many times so I won\u2019t reiterate the wealth of information which is out there.\nBasically WW1 and WW2 are what did it.

But assuming a degree of honour and integrity, then yes \u2018forced\u2019 by agreements made and unfolding hostile events.\nBritain had also long recognised the threat of a single dominant power on the continent, so there were some practical long term considerations for ourselves and for the globe too.

When the Russian Civil War erupted, the Bolsheviks controlled most of the Western part of the former Russian Empire, with most of its cities, including Moscow and Petrograd, coal, grain, manpower and especially industrial powerhouse, while the Whites controlled most of Southern and Eastern Russia. Even though the Whites had more territory and allies like Czech Legion, Allied troops and Japanese troops, they were exhausted after WW1 and the only thing they did was taking small cities like Vladivostok or Murmansk and nothing else. The most important territories the Whites had were large parts of Ukraine and Volga plains, and when they lost them in 1920 and 1921, it was clear they would lose.\nLeadership. While the Reds had brilliant generals like Trotsky which encouraged their troops to fight in the name of freedom, the White Guard had many generals that had different opinions about strategies, so they started to spread their troops in disorder. Compare that to their adversary, the Red Army was better trained, equipped and it had a higher morale. Lenin send most of the former Tsarist officers to train his troops, thus giving a boost to their level of organization. Also, they had more railroads so they could send more reinforcements faster and cheaper than compared with the horse.\nCivil laws. During the Civil War, Lenin implemented the Great Red Terror which threatened his political enemies as well as consolidating his power through force and spilled blood. Every suspect that threatened the Bolshevik Government was executed. Also, more important than that was \u201cWar Communism\u201d, which basically said that they were in total war so that every aspect of the society and every part of the economy should contribute to the war effort.\nFalling of Ukraine, White\u2019s main supply depot. During 1919 there were heavy fights in Volga basin for the city of Tsaritsyn. The Red Army general in that region was future leader Joseph Stalin. If the Whites could have won here, they could have launched an attack on Moscow. But this never happened. They lost 130.000 men while their enemy lost only 80.000, and they retreated in Crimean peninsula, thus giving the Reds access to Ukraine\u2019s grain and coal. From that on, it was clear that the Bolsheviks were going to win the war.\nThat were some of the reasons Whites lost the war, I hope this will help you.", "Much the same that led to the fall of the Reds in the late 1980\u2019s/1990\u2019s: lack of overall support and general fatigue with the given system.\nI am an avid historian regarding the fall of Nicholas II, and much of the fall began long before he became Tsar. His grandfather was killed by a bomb AFTER the grandfather freed the serfs. His relative was also killed by a bomb - \u201cUncle Sergei\u201d - from a disgruntled anarchist. Russia thought it could stop another Napoleon, but it discovered that while it stayed pretty much stable, all surrounding foreign countries had moved far ahead in terms of technology.\nOne may have a huge army, but when your production is so low that you have to ration THREE bullets a day to your soldiers, they are, sooner rather than later, going to give up or demand a change. Thus, the entrance of Lenin.\nNicholas II was simply not \u201cman\u201d enough to keep Russia together during its most trying time: was declared on Russia by Germany. Nicholas and his ministers thought they could outlast the Germans because of the huge gap in population between the two countries. The problem is that Russia was so far behind in industrial production that leading a horse cavalry against a machine gun nest was a losing proposition. Yes, Russia had a much larger population than Germany, but only so many people were willing to be mowed down just for the sake of attrition by the Germans. And, Russians were getting killed at a far greater pace than Germans.\nPlus, Nicholas II truly believed that his people \u201cloved\u201d him and that he was appointed by God to rule Russia. The mistake was believing the Russian people believed this too. They did not.\nAs I mentioned above, Nicholas II was born into a quagmire in Russia, but he did much to undo himself: (1) attend a French ball for the newly minted Emperor within a day or so after several thousand Russians were trampled to death trying to obtain free \u201cgifts\u201d of the coronation; (2) not appointing someone with good sense to disburse the crowd at the Winter Palace when the guards opened fire on an unarmed crown when Nicholas II was not even present at that Palace (again, hundreds needlessly killed); (3) putting up with Rasputin, despite the fact that almost his entire family wanted to kill that monk and that many Russians though Rasputin was having an affair with Nicholas II\u2019s wife, while Nicholas II knew; (4) not sending his wife abroad during the early part of WWI, despite the fact she was of German descent (and Russia was at war with Germany).\nAs Kerensky famously said after he took the reigns of power after Nicholas II\u2019s abdication: Nicholas II had power and no laws; Kerensky had laws and no power.", "Hubris.

As soon as Elizabeth became the English Queen, she curried favour with Philip II of Spain, who certainly did not want the English throne being handed to Mary, causing Spain\u2019s conduit to the Low Countries to be threatened from both sides of the English Channel. With both Spain and France being exhausted by war, neither of them was in a position to embark on all out conflict for the English throne, which the other would be forced to oppose.\nCatherine de Medici\u2019s great fear was that Mary, once returned to Scotland, would arrange to marry Philip II\u2019s son, Don Carlos, so that she could lay claim to the English throne. Nevertheless, she remained unaware that he was mentally unstable. In 1564, she attempted to divert this threat by offering the 13-year-old Charles IX as a husband for Elizabeth, who was 30, but this was never going to succeed. Luckily for her, Philip II removed Don Carlos from contention by locking him away. Catherine who was personally politically moderate, still had to cope with differing factions within France who at various times forced her to take either an Ultra-Catholic or more Humanist stance in French Government, so that at different periods her political stance was either more or less threatening to Protestant England.\nThe English Government was determined to ensure England\u2019s security by pushing Elizabeth into a political marriage, but she did not initially play to their tune. She still hoped to extend her long running romance with Lord Robert Dudley, who the Government considered unacceptable as her consort. The fear was that their marriage would lead to France and Spain combining in a Counter Reformation to depose her. Her remedy was to provide underhand support for the Huguenot rebels in France and the Protestant rebels in the Low Countries, to keep both France and Spain focused on their domestic difficulties. In the end, she came to an unwritten agreement with Catherine de Medici that England would stop interfering on behalf of the Huguenots, and the French would not seek to place Mary Queen of Scots on the English throne.\nNevertheless the English Government still wanted Elizabeth to make a political marriage to provide protection from one or other of the super powers. Unfortunately the French did not have a Royal Prince of appropriate age to become Elizabeth\u2019s spouse, but the Habsburgs could offer the Archdukes Ferdinand and Charles of Austria, and even their elder brother, the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian. Elizabeth played along with these suits, but remained besotted with Lord Robert Dudley, and did her best to undermine her Government\u2019s plans. This of course rather suited the French.\nThis rather complicated balancing act was put in danger by Pope Pius V. Elizabeth had stamped heavily on an English Catholic rebellion, the Northern Rising, in 1569. This had been designed to place Mary Queen of Scots on the English throne (having arranged her marriage to the Duke of Norfolk). Elizabeth\u2019s action caused the Pope to publish a papal bull, Regnans in Excelsis, which excommunicated her. This was strongly opposed by both the French and the Spanish.\nThe various marriage suits rumbled on until Catherine promoted her youngest son, Francis, Duke of Alencon (later Duke of Anjou) to become Elizabeth\u2019s husband in a final attempt to thwart a Habsburg match. By this time, Lord Robert\u2019s eyes had wandered elsewhere, and Elizabeth played along with the Anjou match, so that she could maintain a French alliance as she developed her plan for an invasion of the Low Countries. The death of Anjou ended this alliance and led to Elizabeth\u2019s worst nightmare. The Spanish launched its Armada against England in 1588, in the knowledge that France would remain neutral. With the Armada being defeated, England returned to its policy of support for the Huguenots until the Huguenot Henry of Navarre inherited the French throne and ended the civil war in France by becoming Catholic.

A number of Basran landowners had brought several thousand East African blacks (Zanj) into southern Iraq\nto drain the salt marshes east of Basra\n. The landowners subjected the Zanj, who generally spoke no Arabic, to heavy slave labour\nand provided them with only minimal subsistence. In September 869,\n\u02bfAl\u012b ibn Mu\u1e25ammad, a Persian\nclaiming descent from \u02bfAl\u012b, the fourth caliph, and F\u0101\u1e6dimah, Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s daughter, gained the support of several slave-work crews\u2014which could number from 500 to 5,000 men\u2014by pointing out the injustice of their social position and promising them freedom and wealth. \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s offers became even more attractive with his subsequent adoption of a\nKh\u0101rijite\nreligious stance: anyone, even a black slave, could be elected caliph, and all non-Kh\u0101rijites were infidels threatened by a holy war\n.\nZanj forces grew rapidly in size and power, absorbing the well-trained black contingents\nthat defected from the defeated caliphal armies, along with some disaffected local peasantry. In October 869 they defeated a Basran force, and soon afterward a Zanj capital, al-\nMukht\u0101rah (Arabic: the Chosen), was built on an inaccessible dry spot in the salt flats, surrounded by canals. The rebels gained control of southern Iraq by capturing al-Ubullah (June 870), a seaport on the Persian Gulf\n, and cutting communications to Basra, then seized Ahv\u0101z\nin southwestern Iran\n. The caliphal armies, now entrusted to al-\nMuwaffaq\n, a brother of the new caliph, al-Mu\u02bftamid (reigned 870\u2013892), still could not cope with the rebels. The Zanj sacked Basra in September 871, and subsequently defeated al-Muwaffaq himself in April 872.\nBetween 872 and 879, while al-Muwaffaq was occupied in eastern Iran with the expansion of the \u1e62aff\u0101rids, an independent Persian dynasty\n, the Zanj seized W\u0101si\u1e6d\n(878) and established themselves in Khuzistan, Iran. In 879, however, al-Muwaffaq organized a major offensive against the black slaves. Within a year, the second Zanj city, al-Man\u012b\u02bfah (The Impregnable), was taken. The rebels were next expelled from Khuzistan, and, in the spring of 881, al-Muwaffaq laid siege to al-Mukht\u0101rah from a special city built on the other side of the Tigris River. Two years later, in August\n883, reinforced by Egyptian troops, al-Muwaffaq finally crushed the rebellion, conquering the city and returning to Baghdad\nwith \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s head.\nSlavery in Islam\nSlavery was common in pre-Islamic times and continued under Islam \u00a9\nSlaves were owned in all Islamic societies, both sedentary and nomadic, ranging from Arabia in the centre to North Africa in the west and to what is now Pakistan and Indonesia in the east. Some Islamic states, such as the Ottoman Empire, the Crimean Khanate, and the Sokoto caliphate [Nigeria], must be termed slave societies because slaves there were very important numerically as well as a focus of the polities' energies.\nEncyclopaedia Britannica - Slavery\nMany societies throughout history have practised slavery\n, and Muslim societies were no exception.\nIt's thought that as many people were enslaved in the Eastern slave trade as in the Atlantic slave trade.\nIt's ironic that when the Atlantic slave trade was abolished the Eastern trade expanded, suggesting that for some Africans the abolition of the Atlantic trade didn't lead to freedom, but merely changed their slave destination.\nIt's misleading to use phrases such as 'Islamic slavery' and 'Muslim slave trade', even though slavery existed in many Muslim cultures at various times, since the Atlantic slave trade is not called the Christian slave trade, even though most of those responsible for it were Christians.\nSlavery before Islam\nSlavery was common in pre-Islamic times and accepted by many ancient legal systems and it continued under Islam.\nAlthough Islam is much credited for moderating the age-old institution of slavery, which was also accepted and endorsed by the other monotheistic religions, Christianity and Judaism, and was a well-established custom of the pre-Islamic world, it has never preached the abolition of slavery as a doctrine.\nForough Jahanbaksh, Islam, Democracy and Religious Modernism in Iran, 1953-2000, 2001\nThe condition of slaves, like that of women, may well have improved with the coming of Islam, but the institution was not abolished, any more than it was under Christianity at this period.\nMalise Ruthven, Islam in the World, 2000\nHow Islam moderated slavery\nIslam's approach to slavery added the idea that freedom was the natural state of affairs for human beings and in line with this it limited the opportunities to enslave people, commended the freeing of slaves and regulated the way slaves were treated:\nIslam greatly limited those who could be enslaved and under what circumstances (although these restrictions were often evaded)\nIslam treated slaves as human beings as well as property\nIslam banned the mistreatment of slaves - indeed the tradition repeatedly stresses the importance of treating slaves with kindness and compassion\nIslam allowed slaves to achieve their freedom and made freeing slaves a virtuous act\nIslam barred Muslims from enslaving other Muslims\nBut the essential nature of slavery remained the same under Islam, as elsewhere. It involved serious breaches of human rights and however well they were treated, the slaves still had restricted freedom; and, when the law was not obeyed, their lives could be very unpleasant.\nThe paradox\nA poignant paradox of Islamic slavery is that the humanity of the various rules and customs that led to the freeing of slaves created a demand for new slaves that could only be supplied by war, forcing people into slavery or trading slaves.\nMuslim slavery continued for centuries\nThe legality of slavery in Islam, together with the example of the Prophet Muhammad\n, who himself bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves, may explain why slavery persisted until the 19th century in many places (and later still in some countries). The impetus for the abolition of slavery came largely from colonial powers, although some Muslim thinkers argued strongly for abolition.\nSlaves came from many places\nUnlike the Atlantic slave traders, Muslims enslaved people from many cultures as well as Africa. Other sources included the Balkans, Central Asia and Mediterranean Europe.\nSlaves could be assimilated into Muslim society\nMuhammad's teaching that slaves were to be regarded as human beings with dignity and rights and not just as property, and that freeing slaves was a virtuous thing to do, may have helped to create a culture in which slaves became much more assimilated into the community than they were in the West.\nMuslim slaves could achieve status\nSlaves in the Islamic world were not always at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Slaves in Muslim societies had a greater range of work, and took on a wider range of responsibilities, than those enslaved in the Atlantic trade.\nSome slaves earned respectable incomes and achieved considerable power, although even such elite slaves still remained in the power of their owners.\nMuslim slavery was not just economic\nUnlike the Western slave trade, slavery in Islam was not wholly motivated by economics.\nAlthough some Muslim slaves were used as productive labour it was not generally on the same mass scale as in the West but in smaller agricultural enterprises, workshops, building, mining and transport.\nSlaves were also taken for military service, some serving in elite corps essential to the ruler's control of the state, while others joined the equivalent of the civil service.\nAnother category of slavery was sexual slavery in which young women were made concubines, either on a small scale or in large harems of the powerful. Some of these women were able to achieve wealth and power.\nThese harems might be guarded by eunuchs, men who had been enslaved and castrated.\nWhere did the slaves come from?\nMuslim traders took their slaves from three main areas:\nNon-Muslim Africa, in particular the Horn\nCentral and Eastern Europe\nCentral Asia\nThe legality of slavery today\nWhile Islamic law does allow slavery under certain conditions, it's almost inconceivable that those conditions could ever occur in today's world, and so slavery is effectively illegal in modern Islam. Muslim countries also use secular law to prohibit slavery.\nNews stories do continue to report occasional instances of slavery in a few Muslim countries, but these are usually denied by the authorities concerned.\nIn order to see this content you need to have both Javascript\nenabled and Flash\ninstalled.

Slavery was an established and lawful institution in many parts of the world throughout this period...\n'Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Shari'a and Basic Human Rights Concerns, in Liberal Islam, ed Charles Kurzman, 1998\nSlavery was too fundamental to the structure of Arabian society in the 7th century to be abolished easily. Doing so would have estranged many of the tribes that Muhammad sought to bring together, and severely disrupted the working of society.\nProhibiting slavery in the context of seventh-century Arabia apparently would have been as useful as prohibiting poverty; it would have reflected a noble ideal but would have been unworkable on an immediate basis without establishing an entirely new socioeconomic system.\nJacob Neusner, Tamara Sonn, Comparing Religions through Law: Judaism and Islam, 1999\nBut this was a problem, since Islam placed a high value on human dignity and freedom.\nThe fact that slavery is a major concern in Islamic law no doubt stems from the prevalence of slavery at the time when Islam was instituted combined with the fact that the Qur'an clearly presents universal freedom and human dignity as its ideal society. Its recommendation that slaves be freed is on the same plane as its recommendation that the poor be clothed and the hungry be fed.\nJacob Neusner, Tamara Sonn, Comparing Religions through Law: Judaism and Islam, 1999\nSo the early Muslims restricted and regulated slavery to remove some of its cruelties, but accepted that it was legal.\n... The most that shari'a could do, and did in fact do, in that historical context was to modify and lighten the harsh consequences of slavery and discrimination on grounds of religion or gender...\nShari'a recognized slavery as an institution but sought to restrict the sources of acquisition of slaves, to improve their condition, and to encourage their emancipation through a variety of religious and civil methods.\nNevertheless, slavery is lawful under shari'a to the present day.\n'Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Shari'a and Basic Human Rights Concerns, in Liberal Islam, ed Charles Kurzman, 1998\nIs slavery still legal in Islam?\nThe answer is that slavery is legal under Islamic law but only in theory. Slavery is illegal under the state law of all Muslim countries.\nTheoretically Islamic law lays down that if a person was captured in a lawful jihad or was the descendent of an unbroken chain of people who had been lawfully enslaved, then it might be legal to enslave them.\nNonetheless, should the legal condition for the enslavement of anyone be proven (because he had been taken prisoner fighting against Islam with a view to its extirpation and persisted in invincible ignorance in his sacrilegious and infidel convictions, or because there did exist legal proof that all his ancestors without exception had been slaves descended from a person taken prisoner conducting a warfare of such invincible ignorance) Islam would be bound to recognize such slavery as legal, even though recommending the freeing of the person and if possible his conversion, in this modern age.\nTabandeh, Muslim Commentary on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, quoted in 'Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Shari'a and Basic Human Rights Concerns, in Liberal Islam, ed Charles Kurzman, 1998\nIn practice, it seems virtually impossible that there will ever again be a jihad\nthat is lawfully declared according to the strict letter of the law, and there are no living descendants of lawful slaves, which means that legal enslavement is unthinkable.\nThe law on slavery\nIslamic law recognises slavery as an institution within society, and attempts to regulate and restrict it in various ways.\nDifferent Islamic legal schools differ in their interpretation of Islamic law on slavery. Local customs in Muslim lands also affected the way slaves were treated.\nIn the merchant cities of South-East Asia the sharia helped forge a legal distinction between slave and non-slave unknown in the rural hinterland.\nMore frequently, however, the application of the sharia outside the Middle East was tempered by local customs. This allowed Muslims in regions as distant as Somalia, India and Indonesia to argue for the maintenance of pre-Islamic and other local structures of slavery even if these ran counter to the prescriptions of the sharia.\nGwyn Campbell; Frank Cass, The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia, 2004\nIslamic law clearly recognises that slaves are human beings, but it frequently treats slaves as if they are property, laying down regulations covering the buying and selling of slaves.\nIt encourages the freeing of slaves, which has the good effect of diminishing the slave population of a culture and, paradoxically, the bad effect of encouraging those whose livelihood depends on slave labour to find new ways of acquiring slaves.\nWho can be enslaved\nUnder Islamic law\npeople can only be legally enslaved in two circumstances:\nas the result of being defeated in a war that was legal according to sharia\nif they are born as the child of two slave parents\nOther legal systems of the time allowed people to be enslaved in a far wider range of circumstances.\nThe sharia limits were often either ignored or evaded, and many instances of slave trading by Muslims were in fact illegal, but tolerated.\nThe following groups of people cannot be made slaves:\nFree Muslims, but note that: Slaves who convert to Islam are not automatically freed Children born to legally enslaved Muslims are also slaves\nDhimmis\nSlave rights\nIslamic law gives slaves certain rights:\nSlaves must not be mistreated or overworked, but should be treated well\nSlaves must be properly maintained\nSlaves may take legal action for a breach of these rules, and may be freed as a result\nSlaves may own property\nSlaves may own slaves\nSlaves can get married if their owner consents\nSlaves may undertake business on the owner's behalf\nSlaves guilty of crimes can only be given half the punishment that would be given to a non-slave (although some schools of Islamic law do allow the execution of a slave who commits murder)\nA female slave cannot be separated from her child while it is under 7 years old\nFemale slaves cannot be forced into prostitution\nSlave rights to freedom\nIslamic law allows slaves to get their freedom under certain circumstances. It divides slaves with the right to freedom into various classes:\nThe mukatab: a slave who has the contractual right to buy their freedom over time\nThe mudabbar: a slave who will be freed when their owner dies (this might not happen if the owner's estate was too small)\nThe umm walid, a female slave who had borne her owner a child\nSlaves must accept\nOwners are allowed to have sex with their female slaves\nRestrictions on slaves\nIslamic law imposes many restrictions on slaves:\nSlaves cannot carry out some religious roles\nSlaves can have only limited authority\nSlaves cannot be witnesses in court\nKilling a slave does not carry the death penalty in most schools of Islamic law\nSlaves are punishable under Islamic law if they commit a crime - although for some major crimes they only receive half the punishment of free people\nTop\nMuhammad and slavery\nMuhammad and slavery\nThe Prophet Muhammad\ndid not try to abolish slavery, and bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves himself. But he insisted that slave owners treat their slaves well and stressed the virtue of freeing slaves.\nThere are two different ways of interpreting this:\nsome modern writers believe that Muhammad intended his teachings to lead to the gradual end of slavery by limiting opportunities to acquire new slaves and allowing existing slaves to become free. This idea doesn't appear in early writings.\nothers writers argue that by regulating slavery the Prophet gave his authority to its continued existence, and that by having slaves himself he showed his approval\nMuhammad treated slaves as human beings and clearly held some in the highest esteem.\nFor example, he personally ensured the freedom of Bilal, an African slave who had converted to Islam. Bilal was chosen as the first muezzin of Islam because of his beautiful voice. A muezzin is the person who calls the community to the daily prayers, and is a position of great prominence and responsibility.\nZayd was a young boy who had grown up in the household of the Prophet as a slave, and remained with the household, almost as an adopted son, even after he was freed. He was amongst the first four people to adopt Islam. Indeed when Zayd's father (a wealthy nobleman) tracked his son down and offered to buy his freedom from Muhammad, Muhammad told Zayd that he was free to go with his father with no money changing hands, and to his father's astonishment Zayd chose to stay with Muhammad.\nThe Prophet also married a Coptic Christian slave girl.\nIn his lifetime the Prophet introduced the following rules about slavery:\nStated that freeing slaves was the act that God found most acceptable Zakat\n(charity - the third Pillar of Islam\n) was often used by the state to free slaves\nStated that freeing a slave was the appropriate way to gain forgiveness for certain wrongs\nOrdered that those who committed certain wrongs should be penalised by having to free their slaves\nStated that slaves should be allowed to buy their freedom, and if necessary should be given the opportunity to earn money, or be lent money by the state, in order to do so\nAllowed slaves to be freed in certain circumstances\nStated that slaves' contracts should be interpreted in favour of the slaves\nStated that the duty of kindness towards slaves was the same of that towards family, neighbours and others\nStated that when a slave owner had a child with a female slave, the child should be freed and could inherit from their father like any other child (as in the case of Ibrahim\n)\nThere are a number of hadith that show that the Prophet treated slaves well and expected others to do the same...\nHe will not enter Paradise who behaveth ill to his slaves. The Companions said, 'O Apostle of God! have you not told us, that there will be a great many slaves and orphans amongst your disciples?' He said, 'Yes; then be kind to them as to your own children, and give them to eat what you eat yourselves. The slaves that say their prayers are your brothers.\nBe kind to slaves as to your own children...and those that say their prayers are your brethren.\nThey (slaves or servants) are your brothers, and Allah has put them under your command. So the one under whose hand Allah has put his brother, should feed him of what he eats, and give him dresses of what he wears, and should not ask him to do a thing beyond his capacity. And if at all he asks him to do a hard task, he should help him therein.'\n'There are three categories of people against whom I shall myself be a plaintiff on the Day of Judgement. Of these three, one is he who enslaves a free man, then sells him and eats this money'.\nal-Bukhari and Ibn Majjah\nNarrated Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari: \"The Prophet said, 'Give food to the hungry, pay a visit to the sick and release (set free) the one in captivity (by paying his ransom).'\"\nBukhari\nTop\nCompared to the Atlantic slave trade\nSlavery in Muslim cultures and the Atlantic slave trade\nSlavery in Muslim history lasted much longer than the Atlantic slave trade - although slavery had existed in many cultures long before Islam.\nThe Muslim slave trade from Africa seems to have enslaved roughly similar numbers (estimates vary between 11 and 14 million Africans) to the Atlantic slave trade, and the transportation conditions endured by victims of the Eastern trade were probably just as horrible in their own way as those of the Atlantic slave trade.\nOne poignant fact is that when the Atlantic slave trade was abolished the Eastern trade expanded, suggesting that for some Africans the abolition of the Atlantic trade didn't lead to freedom, but merely changed their slave destination.\nSlavery played a significant part in the history of Muslim civilisation, but it was a form of slavery that was inherently different from the 'slave trade' in that the Muslim concept of slavery regarded those enslaved as people who had some, albeit fewer, human rights that must be respected.\nWhat was notably different from the slavery of the western world, however, was the degree to which they [slaves] were protected by Muslim law. When the law was observed, their treatment was good. They might expect to marry and have families of their own, and they had a good chance of being freed. There were also built in avenues of escape.\nGwyn Campbell; Frank Cass, The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia, 2004\nBut even though slavery under Islam could be significantly less harsh that that of the Atlantic slave trade, both involved serious breaches of human rights and restricted liberty. However well they were treated the slaves still had restricted freedom, and when the law was not obeyed their lives could be very unpleasant.\nThe relationship between slave and master in Islam is a very different relationship from that between the American plantation labourer and owner. It was a much more personalized relationship and relatively benevolent. Everything here is relative -- being a slave is being a slave and it shouldn't be romanticized.\nRonald Segal, interview with Suzy Hansen in Salon magazine, 2001\nHere are some of the main differences between Muslim slavery and the Atlantic slave trade:\nThe Atlantic trade lasted from the 15th to 19th centuries, the Eastern trade from the 7th or 9th century to the 20th\nUnder Islam slaves were considered people first, and then property. In the Atlantic trade slaves were considered property not people, and often just regarded as units of productive labour\nIslamic law laid down considerable protection for slaves; those taken for the Atlantic trade had very little protection\nIslamic law only permitted those conquered in legitimate warfare to be enslaved, all other methods being illegal - although this was often ignored - whereas the Atlantic trade enslaved anyone who had commercial value\nIn Islam, slave-owners were forbidden to take young children from their mothers, something common in the Atlantic trade\nThe owner-slave relationship could be kinder in Islam than in the Atlantic trade, and often more personal\nIslam recommends the freeing of slaves in itself as a 'good' religious act and says that slaves who convert to Islam should be freed. Zakat (the requirement for charity) was used by Muslim states to free slaves. There were many other avenues whereby a slave could be freed, for example as expiation for irregularities in other religious rituals; as a result many more slaves were freed than in the Atlantic trade\nUnder Islamic law a slave could take his/her master to the Islamic courts to address a grievance, and the judge had the right to grant freedom against the master's wishes and/or other compensations; there was no such protection for slaves taken by the Atlantic trade\nIslam permitted slaves to attain high office; those taken for the Atlantic trade stayed at the bottom of society\nIn the Atlantic trade there were two males to every female; in the Islamic trade, there were two females to every male\nIslam permitted women to be enslaved for sexual purposes, although not for prostitution\nAfricans were enslaved in the Atlantic trade to work on an industrial scale in agricultural labour; in the Islamic trade they had a far wider variety of roles\nThe Atlantic trade only involved black Africans; Muslim slavery involved many racial groups\nSlavery in the Atlantic trade was highly racist, something prohibited in Islam where there was much less institutionalised racism. Both masters and slaves had a wide range of colours and backgrounds; the result is that former slaves became absorbed into the Islamic world, while former slaves remained a discriminated-against underclass in the USA until comparatively recently\nThe nature of the Atlantic trade and therefore the survival of racism in the West has been one of segregation. There wasn't this separation in Islam. Whites didn't push blacks off the pavement. They didn't forbid restaurants to serve them. I don't think that there's any disputing that slavery was a more benevolent institution in Islam than it was in the West.\nRonald Segal, interviewed in Chicago Sun-Times, 17/02/2002\nTop\nEconomic slavery\nEconomic slavery in Islam\nWestern slavery was motivated by economics - people were enslaved to provide a cheap and disposable workforce on plantations.\nMuslims historically did not use slaves as an engine of economic production on the same scale as the West, although some Muslims profited from the actual trading of slaves.\nThough Arab and Muslim traders became notorious in the supply of African slaves for the American and Caribbean plantations, there are few examples in the annals of Islam of the collective forced labour found in the Western hemisphere.\nMalise Ruthven, Islam in the World, 2000\nThe 9th century slave rebellion in Iraq may have deterred Muslims from the industrial use of slaves by showing the danger of having a very large slave community in any one place. Apart from 9th century Iraq, the largest scale slave use outside the military was on the clove plantations of Zanzibar.\nNonetheless, as William Gervase Clarence-Smith writes, slaves did play a large part in Muslim economies:\n...productive slavery was more extensive in Islam than traditional accounts allow for. Even if large estates were rare, they were not absent.\nMore striking were the numerous slaves on middling and small properties, a phenomenon about which surprisingly little has been written.\nServile labour was also common in workshops, construction, mining, water control, transport by land and sea, and the extraction of marine resources.\nWhether a 'Slave Mode of Production' ever existed in Islam is moot, but the economic role of slavery was substantial, at least in certain places and at specific times.\nWilliam Gervase Clarence-Smith, Islam and Slavery\nSlaves were also used for domestic work, military service, sexual slavery and civil administration.\nThe slave trade\nMuslims did play a significant role in the slave trade itself as providers of slaves to others.\nTop\nElite slavery\nElite slavery\nSomething particular to Islamic slave systems was the creation of a slave elite in some Muslim societies that allowed individuals to achieve considerable status, and even power and wealth, while still remaining in some form of 'enslavement'.\nThe slave elite had enormous value to their Muslim masters because they were a military and administrative group made up of 'outsiders' who didn't have tribal and family allegiances that could conflict with their loyalty to their masters.\nIt was believed that a corps of highly trained slaves loyal only to the ruler and dependent entirely on his good will would serve the state more reliably and efficiently than a hereditary nobility, whose interests might compete with those of the ruler.\nLeslie P. Peirce, The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire, 1993\nThe paradox of elite slavery\nElite slavery is something of a paradox: how can a person have power and hold high office and yet still keep the status of a slave?\nOne answer is that the slave gets authority and high office because they are dependant on the person who gives them their authority and status and who could remove that status if they chose. Thus elite slaves must give total loyalty and obedience to their master in order to maintain their privileges.\nAnother view is that the slave who achieves elite status is no longer really a slave, and is able to use their position and power to free themselves of many of the limitations of slavery. This is less convincing since even elite slaves are at risk of losing their privileged status until they break free completely.\nThe dependency was not all one way - the masters in many ways relied on their elite slaves, because those slaves were the only people they could really trust.\nAnd there was another reason why elite slaves were valuable - precisely because they were slaves, the elite slaves were free of some of the restrictions that limited free people, and this allowed them to do things for their masters that their masters could not otherwise achieve.\nExamples of elite slavery\nTwo examples of elite slavery were the Mamluks and the Devshirme system.\nThe Mamluks\nAn Ottoman Mamluk, by Carle Vernet, 1810 \u00a9\nThe Mamluk system became firmly established in the Abbasid Empire during the 9th century.\nThe Mamluks were 'slave soldiers' who eventually came to rule Egypt for over two centuries from 1250 until overthrown by the Ottomans\nin the 16th century. After a brief period of oppression the Mamluks were able, once again, to play a significant role in running the country.\nMamluks were originally soldiers captured in Central Asia, but later boys aged 12-14 were specifically taken or bought to be trained as slave soldiers. Their slave status was shown by the name 'Mamluk' which means 'owned'.\nAlthough the Mamluks were not free men (they could not, for example, pass anything on to their children) they were elite slaves who were held in high regard as professional soldiers loyal to their Islamic masters.\nHistorians have been fascinated by the uniqueness of the Mamluk phenomenon. It was inhuman in some respects (for example, Mamluks being denied the opportunity to bequeath their positions and privileges to their sons), yet it provided Islam with a superb military force and a sophisticated political system.\nMichael Winter, Egyptian Society under Ottoman Rule, 1517-1798, 1992\nIn 13th century Egypt loyalty to the masters dissolved and the Mamluks established themselves as the ruling dynasty. Once the Mamluks had successfully revolted against their masters they were, of course, no longer slaves.\nThey remained in power for the period 1250-1517.\nThe basic ideal of military slavery - the Mamluk's total loyalty to his master who had bought, trained, maintained and freed him - was a pillar of Mamluk society in Ottoman Egypt, as it had been in the Mamluk Sultanate.\nWhen the master decided that his Mamluk had reached maturity and was ready to assume an office, he set him free, and 'allowed him to grow his beard.' He was now a free man, no longer dependent.\nThe master often appointed these former slaves to army posts, to the beylicate [the beys were high ranking emirs who held important positions in Egyptian government], or to the regimental command. Very often, the master decided whom his former slave would marry, a decision which could advance the Mamluk socially and financially.\nMichael Winter, Egyptian Society under Ottoman Rule, 1517-1798, 1992\nThe devshirme system\nThe devshirme system introduced in the 14th century compelled non-Muslims in parts of the Ottoman Empire to hand over some of their children to be converted to Islam and work as slaves. Some writers say that between half a million to one million people were enslaved in this way over the centuries.\nConquered Christian communities, especially in the Balkans, had to surrender twenty percent of their male children to the state.\nSome of these were trained for government service, where they were able to reach very high ranks, even that of Grand Vezir.\nMany of the others served in the elite military corps of the Ottoman Empire, called the Janissaries, which was almost exclusively made up of forced converts from Christianity.\nThe devshirme played a key role in Sultan Mehmet's conquest of Constantinople, and from then on regularly held very senior posts in the imperial administration.\nMehmet II commands ships at the siege of Constantinople \u00a9\nAlthough members of the devshirme class were technically slaves, they were of great importance to the Sultan because they owed him their absolute loyalty and became vital to his power.\nThis status enabled some of the 'slaves' to become both powerful and wealthy. Their status remained restricted, and their children were not permitted to inherit their wealth or follow in their footsteps.\nNot all writers agree that the devshirme system was beneficial as well as oppressive, and point out that many Christian families were hostile and resentful about it - which is perhaps underlined by the use of force to impose the system.\nThe devshirme system continued until the end of the seventeenth century.\nEunuchs\nMale slaves who had had their sexual organs removed were called eunuchs, and played an important part in some Muslim societies (as they did in some other cultures).\nThey had the advantage for their masters of not being subject to sexual influence, and as they were unlikely to marry, they had no family ties to hinder their devotion to duty.\nEunuch slavery involved compulsory mutilation, which usually took place between the ages of 8 and 12. Without modern medical skills and anaesthetics this was painful, and often led to fatal complications, and sometimes to physical or psychological problems for those who survived the operation.\nEunuchs had a particular role as guardians of the harem and were the main way in which the women of the harem had contact with the world outside.\nIn the Ottoman Empire eunuchs from Africa held considerable power from the mid sixteenth century to the eighteenth.\nIt's recorded that the Ottoman family owned 194 eunuchs as late as 1903, of whom 35 'bore a title of some seniority'.\nEunuchs could also play important military roles.\nTop\nSexual slavery\nSexual slavery - the harem\nConcubinage may be defined as the more or less permanent cohabitation (outside the marriage bond) of a man with a woman or women, whose position would be that of secondary wives, women bought, acquired by gift, captured in war, or domestic slaves.\nEncyclopaedia of Islam\nMuslim cultures are thought to have had more female slaves than male slaves.\nEnslaved women were given many tasks and one of the most common was working as a domestic servant.\nBut some female slaves were forced to become sex workers: not prostitutes, as this is forbidden in Islam, but concubines. Concubines were women who were sexually available to their master, but not married to him. A Muslim man could have as many concubines as he could afford.\nConcubinage was not unique to Islam; the Bible\nrecords that King Solomon and King David\nboth had concubines, and it is recorded in other cultures too.\nBeing a concubine did have some benefits: if a slave woman gave birth to her owner's child, her status improved dramatically - she could not be sold or given away, and when her owner died she became free. The child was also free and would inherit from their father as any other children.\nConcubinage was not prostitution in the commercial sense both because that was explicitly forbidden and because only the owner could legitimately have sex with a female slave; anyone else who had sex with her was guilty of fornication.\nThe harem\nConcubines lived in the harem, an area of the household where women lived separately from men. The nature of Ottoman harems is described by Ehud R Toledano:\nThe harem system grew out of the need in Ottoman society to achieve gender segregation and limit women's accessibility to men who did not belong to their family.\nHouseholds were divided into two separate sections: the selamlik, housing the male members, and the haremlik, where the women and children dwelt.\nAt the head of the women's part reigned the master's mother or his first wife (out of a maximum of four wives allowed by Islam).\nThe concubines were also part of the harem, where all the attendants were women. Male guests of the master were not entertained in the harem.\nAn active and well-developed social network linked harems of similar status across Ottoman towns and villages; mutual visits and outdoor excursions were common.\nFor the women who actually spent their lives in the harems, reality was, of course, far more mixed and complicated.\nThe women who came into the harem as slaves (c\u00e2riyes) were taught and trained to be \"ladies,\" learning all the domestic and social roles attached to that position. As they grew up, they would be paired with the men of the family either as concubines or as legal wives.\nHowever, harem slaves' freedom of choice was rather limited, as was that of women in general in an essentially male-dominated environment. Harem slaves frequently had to endure sexual harassment from male members of the family.\nEhud R. Toledano, Slavery and Abolition in the Ottoman Middle East, 1998\nThe nature of concubinage\nWriters disagree over the nature of concubinage and the harem:\nSome argue that it was seriously wrong in that it was just slavery it breached human rights it exploited women women could be bought and sold, or given as gifts it involved compulsory non-consensual sex - which would nowadays be called 'rape' it reinforced male power in the culture\nOthers say that it was relatively benign, because it gave female slaves a relatively easy existence it gave female slaves a chance to rise socially it gave female slaves a chance to gain power it gave female slaves a chance to gain their freedom\nA balanced view might be to say that sexual slavery in this context was a very bad thing, but that it was possible for some of the more fortunate victims to gain benefits that provided some degree of compensation.\nThe political role of concubines\nConcubines could play an important political role and have considerable direct political influence on the policy of the state.\nMore than any other Muslim dynasty, the Ottomans raised the practice of slave concubinage to a reproductive principle: after the generations of Osman and Orhan, virtually all offspring of the sultans appear to have been born of concubine mothers.\nLeslie P. Peirce, The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire, 1993\nThe benefit to the state, or at least to the ruling dynasty, of having the ruling line born through concubines rather than wives was that only one family was involved - the family of a concubine was irrelevant, but the family of a wife would expect to gain power and influence through their relationship to the mother of the son. These conflicting interests could threaten the succession and weaken the ruling family. (This didn't eliminate conflict between heirs and families altogether, but it probably reduced it.)\nConcubines as well as wives also played an important role in strengthening cohesion, stability, and continuity at household level too, as this remark about 18th century Cairo demonstrates:\nMarital and nonmarital unions strengthened the links among men; women legitimized the succession of men to power, and women's property ownership added to the overall wealth, prestige, and power of a household.\nMary Ann Fay, From Concubines to Capitalists: Women, Property, and Power in Eighteenth-century Cairo, Journal of Women's History, 1998\nAnd later in the same article the writer describes the inevitable tension inherent in the status of harem women in that society:\nHowever, the harem was not a prison; it was instead the family quarters of an upper-class home which became exclusively female space when men not related to the women were in the house and whose entry into the harem was forbidden. Women, heavily veiled, could and did leave their homes...\n... Women were not imprisoned in the harem or in the veils and cloaks that concealed their bodies and faces on the street, but both customs were important signifiers of women's lack of sexual autonomy and of men's control over the selection of women's sexual and marital partners.\nIn the economic sphere, however, women had a great deal of autonomy...\n... Therefore, the eighteenth-century Egyptian household should not be seen as the site of unrelieved oppression of women but rather in terms of asymmetries of power between men and women.\nMary Ann Fay, From Concubines to Capitalists: Women, Property, and Power in Eighteenth-century Cairo, Journal of Women's History, 1998\nIn the Ottoman Empire the sale of woman as slaves continued until 1908.\nTop\nAbolition\nMuslims and the abolition of slavery\nSlavery remained part of the fabric of Islam for over 1200 years (although the Druze, a group that sprung from Muslim roots, abolished it in the 11th century).\nWhile slavery was in theory greatly limited by Islamic law, in practice it persisted on a large scale in Muslim lands.\nDuring the 20th century attitudes to slavery changed radically and in 1990 The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam stated that:\nHuman beings are born free, and no one has the right to enslave, humiliate, oppress or exploit them, and there can be no subjugation but to God the Most-High.\nArticle 11, Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, 1990\nThe Declaration also includes a number of other articles that are incompatible with slavery, although \"All the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic Shari'ah\n\".\nSince slavery is permitted by Islamic law, Muslim countries have used secular law to ban it. Some countries outlawed slavery only comparatively recently:\nQatar in 1952\nYemen and Saudi Arabia in 1962\nMauritania in 1980\nEarly opponents\nMughal painting of Akbar as a boy, circa 1557 \u00a9\nThe idea that slavery should be abandoned began to be seriously discussed in the 16th century. The Mughal\nEmperor Akbar (1556-1605) banned the slave trade in his Indian territory.\nThe Muslim leader and reformer Nasr al-Din denounced slavery to the people of Senegal in the 1670s and banned the sale of slaves to Christians there, undermining the French trade in slaves.\nIn some countries, slaves who held high rank demonstrated that slaves were perfectly capable of playing any role in society if they were freed. Egypt had even been ruled by a slave dynasty for more than a century. These traditions slowly changed some Muslim thinking about slavery, and gradually created a climate in which the pressure for abolition could build.\nBut serious abolition for the Muslim world had to wait until the 19th century.\nAttacking the slave trade\nBecause slavery was accepted by Islamic law it would have been difficult or impossible to forbid slavery itself, so the abolition pressure was concentrated on the transportation of slaves, including the slave markets, which was where the worst cruelties were to be found.\nIslam forbade raids to gain slaves, making a slave out of a free person and other cruelties. So Muslim abolitionists focused on showing slave trading was illegal under Islamic law, knowing that if they could stop the trade in slaves, slavery itself would slowly die out from lack of supply. For the same reason, colonial powers attacked the trade in slaves as much as the institution of slavery.\nThe slave trade in Muslim societies ended not so much through a single act of abolition but by withering away as the result of external and internal pressure.\nThe outside pressure came from colonial powers that had only recently abandoned slavery themselves:\nColonial powers such as Britain and France applied great pressure for the abolition of slavery in their dominions. This pressure was successful in some places, like Egypt, but much less influential in others.\nColonial powers also took direct action against slave traders: the British Navy played a role in intercepting and taking action against slave traders, and between 1817 and 1890 signed treaties with over 80 territories allowing them to do this.\nChristian missionaries, including David Livingstone, aroused public indignation in the West.\nInternal pressure came from a variety of Muslim sources:\nFrom the 1870s, radical and gradual rationalists, together with moderate literalists and progressive ulama, could all be placed in the broad category of opponents of slavery, despite their manifold disagreements.\nWilliam G. Clarence-Smith, Religions and the abolition of slavery - a comparative approach\nMuslim abolitionists were influenced by factors like these:\nThe abolition of the Atlantic slave trade provided an enlightening example\nSome Muslim thinkers readdressed Islamic ideas on human equality\nSome Muslim thinkers saw slavery as colonialist/imperialist behaviour that was incompatible with growing anti-colonialism\nSome Muslim thinkers regarded slavery as an activity incompatible with the modern world\nChanges in culture brought about by factors such as urbanisation, changes in the demand for labour, education, a desire to relate to Western nations as equals\nAn increase in the freeing of slaves in some territories helped to accustom people to the ending of slavery\nThe result of these forces was to shrink the slave trade, and put pressure on slavery itself.\nInitially, it was a source of great hostility that the West dared to intervene in Islamic affairs in contradiction to what was allowed by the Koran.\nBut as Western influence, or modernism, became more and more [widespread], it became less fashionable as well as profitable in Islam to own slaves. And it became illegal over much of the area.\nThe pressures against slavery were extremely great from Western powers. It was the moral issue. It became more scandalous because the conditions of procurement and transport became more and more horrendous.\nRonald Segal, interview with Suzy Hansen, Salon Magazine, 2001\nAbolition\nThe Ottoman Empire was the major Muslim slave society of the abolition period, and it abolished the slave trade in stages.\nAlthough the Ottomans never abolished slavery itself, their policy of restricting the slave trade and increasing opportunities for slaves to get their freedom greatly reduced the number of slaves in its territories:\n1847: slave trade banned in Persian Gulf\n1857: African slave trade banned\n1864: Traffic in Georgian and Circassian child slaves restricted\n1867: Programme introduced to help slaves from Russia get their freedom\n1887-1880: Conventions against the slave trade signed with Britain\n1890: Brussels Act against slave trade signed\nSlavery was harder to outlaw in areas far from central government where tribal traditions had been less influenced by the factors above, and where the military power of the centre was much weaker.\nThe slavers retreated into these areas, and moved their slaves to market more secretly. Quite a few of the anti-slavery military initiatives ended in victory for the slavers rather than the forces of abolition.\nSome other Muslim countries passed laws allowing for the prosecution not only of the sellers of slaves but the buyers too.\nThe Indian Slavery Act of 1844 made slavery illegal there, and Egypt in 1896 implemented laws with very severe penalties for slaving activities.\nBritish colonial power played a major role, enforcing treaties that prohibited slaving.\nThe British felt that they had a mission to do this - as can be seen from this Foreign Office document of 1861:\nCaptain Hamerton should take every opportunity of impressing upon these Arabs that the nations of Europe are destined to put an end to the African Slave Trade, and that Great Britain is the main instrument in the Hands of Providence for the accomplishment of this purpose.\nThat it is in vain for these Arabs to endeavour to resist the consummation of that which is written in the Book of Fate, and that they ought to bow to superior power, to leave off a pursuit which is doomed to annihilation, and a perseverance in which will only involve them in losses and other evils.\nBritish Foreign Office document, 1861\nThe British action did not gain universal support. The Sultan of Zanzibar wrote to the British Consul:\nIf I put a stop to the traffic in slaves it will ruin these countries, and it will ruin my subjects; and I am sure that the British Government would never agree to this; my friend, it is in my wish to comply with all the desires of the British Government but these countries cannot do without slaves. For the British Government is far off, and does not know the circumstances of these countries.\nlinks\nBreaking the Chains: 9 Pivotal Slave Rebellions From Ancient Times to the 19th Century\nZanj rebellion | \u02bfAbb\u0101sid history\nSlavery in Islam"], "topic_list": ["Caliphates", "Rebellions and Unrest", "History of Slavery", "Slavery", "Roman Empire", "Ancient Rome", "Ancient History", "World History", "Islam", "History", "India"], "view_list": [1], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Aakash Paran Baishya", "upvote_list": [0], "question_title": "Just like the three servile wars or slave rebellions in the Roman Empire, were there also slave rebellion in Islamic Caliphate, as slavery has been wide spread in the Islamic world?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "179", "name_list": ["Aakash Paran Baishya"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020"]}, "777": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["YouTube Channels Recommendations", "Educational YouTube Channels", "Mysteries", "Temples", "YouTube Channels", "YouTube Videos", "Videos", "YouTube", "History", "India"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Anusree Rao", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "Is it a good idea to start a YouTube channel about fascinating mysteries of India and some miraculous temples as some history knowledge and add it to people's interests?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "227", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "1": {"ans_list": ["Adolf Hitler himself of course.\nBombed his own People with a V2 Rocket.\nHard to see any value in doing that not that the Germans didn't have it coming.

BHATNAGAR\nPART 2 \u2013 IT\u2019S ORIGIN AND VERY IMPORTANT DETAILS.\nBTW, DID YOU KNOW?\n\nIn Arabic \u201cQutub\u201d literally means \u2018axis\u2019, \u2018pivot\u2019 or \u2018pole\u2019. Qutb can refer to celestial movements and used as an astronomical term or a spiritual symbol. So the term \u2018Qutub Minar\u2019 signifies an astronomical Tower. That was how it was described to Sultan and later referred to in court correspondence. In course of time the name of Sultan Qutubuddin came to be unwittingly associated with the Qutub Tower leading to the misleading assertion that Qutubuddin built the Qutub Minar.\nPART 1.\n\n\u2013 by Prof. M.S. Bhatnagar, Ghaziabad (India)\nJune 10, 1977\nThis unique and unprecedented diagram (Fig 1) is that of the so-called QUTB MINAR. It uncovers the truth and knocks out all confusing, contradictory and fabricated explanations given by chroniclers of the Moslem Kings of Delhi and some archaeologists about the history and purpose of this lofty stone-tower.\nA visit which fostered the present research :\nIn 1961, some college students went with me to the Qutb Minar and engaged an official guide, an M.A. in History. Questions and answers between our party and the Sarkari guide are given below in brief :-\nQ. What was the purpose of building this \u2018MINAR\u2019 ?\nA. Victory Tower.\nQ. Whose victory over whom ?\nA. Md. Ghori\u2019s victory over Rai Pithaura (Prithvi Raj)\nQ. Where ?\nA. At Tarain near Panipat.\nQ. Why is the Victory Tower at Delhi ?\nA. Do not know.\nOne gentleman from the visitors, a Lecturer in History in the University of Delhi, took up the threat and answered:\nThe Victory Tower was commenced by Ghori because Delhi became his capital.\nQ. Objection, Sir! Ghori never had his capital at Delhi. His capital was at Ghazni. What logic is there in building the Victory Tower in Delhi ?\nA. Silence.\nQ. Even if the Minar was commenced by Ghori, its name ought to have been \u2018GHORI MINAR\u2019 and not \u2018QUTB MINAR\u2019. Why is it called \u2018Qutb Minar\u2019 ?\nA. It was probably Qutubuddin Aibak, slave of Ghori, who laid the foundation of the minar for his master.\nQ. If this is true, what made him choose Delhi as the site for the Victory Tower?\nA. Delhi was the capital of Qutbuddin Aibak.\nQ. It is said that the building of the Minar was commenced during the life time of Ghori. When Ghori was alive, the question of his slave\u2019s capital being at Delhi does not arise. After the death of Ghori, Qutbuddin was crowned at Sultan at Lahore. He ruled from Lahore and not Delhi and ultimately died at Lahore. His capital was at Lahore ? Why did he build the Victory Tower at Delhi ?\nA. Silence.\nSomebody from the audience asserted that the Minar was not a victory tower but a \u2018Mazina\u2019 (Muezzin\u2019s Tower in mosque) attached to \u2018Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque\u2019.\nQ. The word \u2018Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque\u2019 is unknown to contemporary history of India. This word was coined by Sir Saiyid Ahmad Khan in the first part of the nineteeth century. Do not be surprised to know that the name \u2018QUTB MINAR\u2019 too, is not known to Indian History. It is also a recent fabrication. If, for the sake of argument, we take it for granted that the minar is a muezzin\u2019s tower, the mosque assumes primary importance and the tower secondary, but unfortunately the mosque, as you see it, is in complete ruins. How do you account for the mosque of primary importance to be in ruins and the muezzin\u2019s tower, a building of no consequence, to be standing in full majesty ?\nA. No Answer.\n\u2018Masjid & Mazina\u2019 with regard to the Qutb Minar is a \u201cCOCK & BULL STORY\u201d. The so called Qutb Minar and the ruined Jama Masjid close by cannot be ascribed to the same builder. The Qutb Minar is a much older tower.\nQuranic inscriptions on the Minar\nThe Quranic inscriptions on the Minar are forced and lifeless insertions between forceful and beautiful frieze-bands of the pure HINDU DESIGN. To consider the minar of Moslem origin from the Quranic inscriptions would be labelling a non-Muslim as a Mussalman because circumcision has been forced on him.\nThe Dhruv Stambha\nThe pillars of Shri Vishnu Temple, just adjacent to the Dhruv Stambh (Qutub Minar), illuminated at night\nThe Minar is in fact the Dhurva Stambha or the central observation tower of an ancient Hindu Astronomical Observatory. Fig. 1 is based on observation from a two seater aeroplane made to hover over the top of the DHRUVA STAMBHA. The tower looks like a 24-petalled lotus flower (Fig. 2), each petal representing an \u201cHORA\u201d, i.e., an hour on a 24-hour dial (Fig. 3). Vertical projection lines drawn from the mid points of stone-flutings on the top of each storey of the tower to the horizontal plane at its base create a lotus flower similar to what can be seen from the sky over the top of the tower \u2013 bottom fig. 1. (Note : Please refer below scanned pages for reference of figures mentioned in this paragraph)\nFig. 1\nFig. 2\nFig. 3\nThe 24-petalled architectural lotus flower is purely a Hindu concept. It cannot be attributed to any Moslem king from dry parts of Western Asia where lotuses do not grow.\nYou are the proud possessor of the \u2018LOTUS\u2019 projection of the DHRUVA STAMBHA which is the result of original thinking, perseverance and expense. Such a projection was neither drawn nor conceived by any architect or archaeologist in the past. Let any body come forward and challenge the statement. Now, you can reasonably silence all those who believe the DHRUVA STAMBHA to be a production of Md. Ghori or Qutbuddin Aibak. Sultans associated with this \u2018Minar\u2019 defiled its casing, reversed stones bearing human or animal figures and inserted Arabic Inscriptions. These Sultans can, of course, be praised for not making any claim that they built the \u2018Minar\u2019. No body has left any inscription asserting that he started the Minar.\nPART 2 : Its origins\nAbout the Qutub Minar itself...(more)", "Please visit\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19760930-qutab-minar-was-not-originally-a-hindu-monument-say-experts-819348-2015-04-11"], "topic_list": ["Qutb Minar (Monument in New Delhi, India)", "Human Psychology", "Monuments", "Controversies", "Delhi", "Historical India", "Architecture", "Mumbai, Maharashtra, India", "New Delhi", "Psychology", "History", "India"], "view_list": [39, 16], "create_time": "Jul 27, 2019", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Siddharth Das", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "question_title": "What are some controversies of Qutub Minar?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "607", "name_list": ["Rani", "Dhanush Dhari Misra"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Oct 21, 2019"]}, "3": {"ans_list": ["Well, Hitler WAS the leader of the National SOCIALIST Party, so that might give you a hint about his leanings \u2026", "\u201cHow true is it when conservatives say that Hitler was a socialist, and just how much is it tolerated by real historians?\u201d\nRight - national socialist. left - Soviet socialist.\nIt shows that socialism is not even ON the left-right spectrum.\nIt also shows that Hitler was a far right socialist.\nLook, you don\u2019t want these words to mean what history says they mean.

But became a clear enemy of socialism on most issues.\nHitler was never even partly socialist, unlike Gregor Strasser\n, whom he had killed.\nSee also Nazis No More Socialists than Bismarck Was.", "The idea that Hitler was a socialist has become a popular talking point among more right-wing people who are keen to discredit socialism by any means necessary.\nI would like to see if we can figure out how this came about.\nThe idea has become popular because it very neatly suits the tendency of some people to treat politics and history as a matter of labels and definitions, and their parallel tendency to completely ignore history and human experience.\nI suppose I\u2019ve read quite a few reputable history books about the Third Reich, including Richard J. Evans\u2019 The Coming of the Third Reich and The Third Reich in Power; Joachim Fest\u2019s biography of Hitler, and his book of psychological profiles of the Nazi leaders, The Face of the Third Reich; Ian Kershaw\u2019s The Hitler Myth and his two-volume biography of Hitler, Hubris and Nemesis.\nI\u2019ve also read works which have since been superseded, such as Lucy Dawidowicz\u2019s The War Against the Jews, 1933\u20131945, which argued that Hitler\u2019s long-term plan from the beginning had been to exterminate the Jewish people, and that everything else he did was done with that plan in mind\u2014an argument which founders somewhat on the considerable body of evidence that there was no such long-term plan in mind from the beginning, other than Hitler saying that he wanted to do it, which isn\u2019t quite the same thing; and that the evidence for the very real plan to exterminate the European Jews all dates not from the earliest years of the Reich but from within WW2, and (to be sure) was made easier by the habits of anti-semitism that Dawidowicz spent her long career deploring.\nI\u2019ve also read a considerable number of writers from that period, including English-language ones such as George Orwell, W.H. Auden and T.S. Eliot, all of whom had things to say about the nature of Nazism and Hitler, and German-language ones as diverse as Victor Klemperer, a literary academic of Jewish background who managed to survive the war within Germany; Ernst J\u00fcnger, a conservative non-Nazi who\u2019d been a war hero in WW1 and who spent the war as a Wehrmacht officer in occupied France; and Walter Benjamin, a Jewish literary critic and philosopher with Marxist inclinations who observed the rise of Nazism and died while trying to flee from it.\nAnd I\u2019ve even read lesser-known writers of the era who had personal experience of Germany and felt a certain fondness for the place, such as the poet and novelist Stevie Smith and my own grandfather, the playwright and broadcaster Denis Johnston. In my grandfather\u2019s case, he was to a certain degree unwilling to think that there was anything so intrinsically wrong with a movement of national renewal\u2014until, that is, he saw the interior of Buchenwald concentration camp after its liberation.\nOne of the reasons I\u2019ve read all these is that, when studying history, it helps to know what people at the time thought was going on. Other than Hitler himself, certainly.\nAnd one of the common threads in people\u2019s experience is that, at the time, nobody had any great difficulty distinguishing between, on the one hand, Hitler and the Nazi Party, and, on the other hand, socialism in Germany. This is one of the basic facts of German history as presented in the works listed above.\nT.S. Eliot, who in the 1930s was at his most sternly conservative as a writer, might be thought to be someone who could have felt some sympathy towards the Nazis, especially given some of the more notorious lines in his poetry about \u2018the jew\u2019, and his comment in a lecture in a US university that large numbers of \u2018free-thinking Jews\u2019 were \u2018undesirable\u2019. But we might also well expect that Eliot would be staunchly anti-socialist.\nHere he is writing in 1935 to his cousin Henry Eliot Scott (from volume 7 of The Letters of T.S. Eliot. This is before the war, remember:\nI was much interested by your enquiry of the 19th, particularly as I had supposed that there was hardly any interest in America in any of the forms of fascism. It is not easy to express briefly any general opinion on fascism, because it varies so much from country to country. At any rate, the Italian and German versions differ considerably, and it seems to be of the nature of fascism to develop its theories after it has become established. At any rate, that was the case in Italy, where it apparently endeavoured to find a basis of political philosophy in the work of Pareto and Sorel. In Germany, on the other hand, it seems to have started with a few definite ideas of an agrarian and guild socialist type, which have disappeared into the background as the National Socialist Party has got more and more closely associated with big capital.\nEliot says here what we know, from the historical record, to be true: the German Workers Party, the forerunner of the Nazi Party, contained socialist elements in its platform, which were later expunged when Hitler and his faction took control of the party in 1934. Hitler regarded Italian fascism and Nazism as two forms of fascism, not as forms of socialism, which he thought Nazism had at first embraced, and had then dropped. The Nazi party could not have gained power, and did not gain it, without the support of the business classes in Germany. Eliot had a keen interest in foreign affairs, having worked for eight years on the foreign accounts desk at Lloyds Bank in London.\nThe Nazis aligned themselves in opposition to the two political parties in Germany that did espouse socialism as an ideology: the Social Democrat Party, and the Communist Party of Germany. Both parties were made illegal after the Nazis gained overall power.\nThose who claim that the Nazis were socialists, are obliged to explain why this happened.\nThey usually don\u2019t respond, but inasmuch as I have seen half-hearted attempts to deal with the embarrassing fact that the Nazis declared actual socialist parties to be their mortal enemies and indeed enemies of Germany as such, it\u2019s usually along the lines that the Nazi/socialism fight was a sort of internal squabble between different socialist factions, with the Nazis coming out on top.\nTo which we can only say: Nobody thought so at the time, especially not the many social democrat, socialist and communist politicians and party members who the Nazis murdered.\nAfter 1934, the ideology of the Nazi party was not socialism, but a particularly violent and exclusivist form of nationalism, organised around a very particular set of notions about ethnic purity, which dictated that only some German citizens were truly German, and therefore deserving of the benefits of citizenship, while others\u2014mostly the German Jews\u2014were not German at all but inescapably foreign, and by nature subversive of German nationhood and German national unity.\nOkay: now we get to why people are trying to make Hitler out to be something which nobody at the time thought he was, and which no reputable historian now considers him to have been.\nHitler was always on the right of the German Workers Party, and he led the right wing of the Nazi Party to victory over the socialist elements.\nHe disliked the socialist elements in the party program, partly because he was generally hostile to communism and Marxism: even one of the other answers to this question, attempting to cite Hitler\u2019s own words that he was a socialist, couldn\u2019t help quoting Hitler\u2019s own bizarre definition of \u2018socialism\u2019:\nCommunism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists. Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality, and unlike Marxism, it is patriotic.\nThis is, frankly, historically illiterate nonsense. Communism is a form of socialism, and Marxism is a particular way of analysing socio-economic conditions that aligns itself against capitalism, and with forms of social ownership that are common elements of socialism as a school of thought.\nBut let\u2019s look at the date on those words.\nHitler said that in 1923.\nHe said in an interview\nwith the journalist George Sylvester Viereck, and he said it in response to Viereck\u2019s question, Why do you call yourself a National Socialist, since your party programme is the very antithesis of that commonly accredited to socialism?\nIn other words, Viereck himself found it puzzling that the Nazis called themselves National Socialists, and Hitler, by way of response, basically bullshitted him.\nIf we go forward ten years to later on Hitler\u2019s Wikiquote page, we find Hitler striking a rather different note.\nHere he is in 1932, speaking to the Industry Club, sounding more like Ayn Rand:\nThis whole edifice of civilization is in its foundations and in all its stones nothing else than the result of the creative capacity, the achievement, the intelligence, the industry, of individuals: in its greatest triumphs it represents the great crowning achievement of individual God-favored geniuses, in its average accomplishment the achievement of men of average capacity, and in its sum doubtless the result of the use of human labor-force in order to turn to account the creations of genius and of talent. So it is only natural that when the capable intelligences of a nation, which are always in a minority, are regarded only as of the same value as all the rest, then genius, capacity, the value of personality are slowly subjected to the majority and this process is then falsely named the rule of the people. For this is not rule of the people, but in reality the rule of stupidity, of mediocrity, of half-heartedness, of cowardice, of weakness, and of inadequacy\nIn 1939, he makes grand claims for how Germany has become a nation of \u2018social welfare\u2019 and \u2018social equality\u2019, but conveniently omits to mention that it has also taken away the civil rights of its Jewish citizens, forbidding them from owning businesses, work in shops, drive cars, go to the cinema, own weapons or attend schools with non-Jews. The Romani people in Germany had been shipped off to camps from as early as 1935.\nAnd still he harps on about National Socialism, at a time when he\u2019s also saying things like:\nGermany neither intends nor wishes to interfere in the internal affairs of Austria, to annex Austria, or to conclude an Anschluss.\n(Speech in the Reichstag, 21 May 1935)\nAnd:\nWe want to be a peace-loving element among the nations. We cannot repeat that often enough.\n(Speech in the Reichstag, 30 January 1936)\nAnd:\nThe motto must be, \"Never war again.\"\n(Speech in Berlin, 1 May 1938)\nIt\u2019s all very well saying that Hitler himself said he was a socialist.\nWe have to look at what he meant by saying that, and when he said it, and to who he said it; and also bear in mind that he said a shitload of other things which we can now all too clearly see, he didn\u2019t mean.\nWhy are we obliged to always take Hitler at his word?\nBy the late 30s, as a read of his Wikiquote page shows, Hitler was basically using \u2018socialism\u2019 as a synonym for \u2018totalitarianism\u2019.\nHis use of the word \u2018socialism\u2019 in no way resembles the way an actual socialist would use it.\nBut this is also the way people use it, who say that Hitler was a socialist. They have essentially adopted Hitler\u2019s definition of socialism, in order to discredit socialism as such.\nThe reason is that such people cannot tell the difference between social democracy, or socialism, and totalitarianism. To them, all the history I\u2019ve recounted in this answer is simply irrelevant. If Hitler said he was a socialist, we automatically take him at his word, and therefore socialism, however we define it, is something that Hitler would have approved of.\nWhatever these people don\u2019t like, they label \u2018socialism\u2019.\nWe\u2019ve seen with the COVID-19 pandemic how some Americans have equated social distancing, a means of preventing the spread of a highly contagious disease, with communism.\nThis is the triumph of inanity in our contemporary political discourse.\nIf the state does anything at all, it is socialism, and therefore totalitarianism, and therefore something that Hitler would do.\nWhat actually went on in the Third Reich and its territories, the things that made it so striking and so horrific\u2014the persecution of Jews, of Roma, of socialists and communists, of LGBT people; the extermination of the mentally ill and mentally disabled; the concentration camps; the Einsatzgruppen; the invasion and conquest of other sovereign countries and the plunder of their resources; the assassinations; the gas chambers\u2014all of this is irrelevant to the game of labels that these people are playing.\nThey are brushing aside millions of deaths, untold suffering of innocent people, they are painting over a vast and awful history, in the name of short-term political goals. And they seize on whatever scrap of evidence they can find to do so, and ignore the mountain that supports a very, very different point of view.\nI\u2019ll leave you with one more quote from Hitler, which may or may not serve to warn us against taking him at his word. He said it to Franz Halder, one of his generals, who was dismissed in 1942 for arguing with Hitler too much, and who sat out the end of the war in prison:\nYou will never learn what I am thinking. And those who boast most loudly that they know my thought, to such people I lie even more.", "Well, labeling people \u201cconservatives\u201d and \u201creal historians\u201d here is pretty pointless because it adds nothing to the discussion of whether National Socialism is a form of socialism.\nSome say it was\u2026and by some measures it was\u2026but by others it wasn\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s a matter of opinion, not fact. Political leanings are labels, not testable by reason, and shift with politics.", "It is true that Hitler was a socialist, going by the fact that he called his party the National Socialist Party.\nThe problem for historians is that the word \u201csocialism\u201d has many, many different meanings to different people in different contexts. For example, some people call Denmark\u2019s government \u201csocialism,\u201d but Denmark herself denies it.\nFor some readers, \u201ctrue\u201d socialism must be International only. For these readers, the phrase, \u201cNational Socialist\u201d is an oxymoron.\nYet there are many types of national socialism, and the Nazi Party is only one of those.\nWhat made the Nazi Party \u201csocialist\u201d is that Hitler\u2019s State took complete control of all economic decisions. Hitler pulled Germany out of the Great Depression by breaking the Versailles Treaty. He made Full Employment (for all white males) by building a massive war machine.\nStarting around 1933, German factories ran at full capacity building tanks, airplanes, submarines, battleships, bombs, canons, machine guns, ammunition and a 5,000 mile freeway for the tanks. Hitler increased his 100,000 man Army to a million troops, and then two million, and then three million.\nEverybody had a job guaranteed by the State. That is one legitimate definition of \u201csocialism.\u201d (The fact that \u201ceverybody\u201d was there defined as \u201cwhite males\u201d only, is another problem.)\nIt\u2019s fair to call that one version of \u201csocialism.\u201d It seemed to work great for six years, but then after you\u2019ve built up the biggest Army the world had ever seen \u2014 what do you do with it?\nHitler decided to attack another version of \u201csocialism\u201d, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and take their territory. Most Germans hated Communism, and the USSR was Communist. For some readers, Communism is the \u201ctrue\u201d socialism, because it is International.\nNazis hated Communists, and Communists hated Nazis \u2014 though they were both \u201ctechnically\u201d socialists. German National Socialism (1930\u20131945) was built upon the myth of Aryan Supremacy. Russian Soviet Socialism (1917\u20131991) was built upon the myth of Marx\u2019s Labor Theory of Value.\nBoth were built upon errors, and so both have collapsed. Yet both had a legitimate right to that very imprecise word, \u201csocialism.\u201d", "It\u2019s a right wing lie and no responsible historian has any truck with it.", "Hitler called himself a socialist. Is that good enough for you?\nSince we are socialists, we must necessarily also be antisemites because we want to fight against the very opposite: materialism and mammonism\u2026\nand\nSocialism is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism.\netc\nAdolf Hitler - Wikiquote", "The word NAZI means National Socialism. The government is based on socialist principles of government control over business and industry and the lives of its people. But it is different from Communist Socialism practiced by the then Soviet Union. Germany and the Soviet Union were rivals, so Soviet Communism was outlawed in Germany. Both countries had mass killings of dissidents. NAZI ism was worse, because it targeted innocent people, based on prejudice.", "How true is it when conservatives say that Hitler was a socialist,\nIt\u2019s not true, it\u2019s false. Hitler and his Nazi party hated socialists. Nor do conservatives claim this: uninformed rightwingers do, and beign rightwing doesn\u2019t make you a conservative. Case in point: Hitler.\nand just how much is it tolerated by real historians?\nHistorians (real or otherwise) tolerate lots of opinions. However, they are prone to point out that this claim is simply historically and factually inaccurate.\nIf Hitler had been a socialist, he would never have received financial support from arch-conservative capitalists. Unlike certain modern would-be conservatives, they knew exactly what Hitler and the Nazis stood for.\nThe NSDAP always was a right wing extremist party. After gaining power they imprisoned frst communists, then socialists. (And then outlawed all parties save theirs.)", "Imagine presenting a sea lion to a group of biologists and insisting that it is a lion. It must be, it's got lion in the name! And sure, if you focus in on tiny parts of its appearance and behaviour you might be able to make a meaningful (or at least not entirely nonsensical) comparison to the appearance of the corresponding part or an aspect of the behaviour of a lion. But when you look at the whole creature and insist that a semi aquatic, flipper footed pinniped is actually a big cat which abhors water you're going to get asked politely but firmly to leave.\nThe Nazis were not socialists. They locked up socialists, banned trade unions and literally killed off their socialist party members when they were no longer useful.\nA sea lion is not a lion.", "It's like pointing out that Tiny Tim was a singer as a way to denigrate singing. Hitler was a nationalist, as is trump. And he used nationalism as an excuse to turn his hatred and biases into policy, as does trump. No, trump isn't hitler. It's a matter of degree and time.", "The word \u201cSocialist\u2019 means more-or-less anything.

A generation or two ago Jews weren\u2019t considered White, but today they are. Go back a generation or two further and Irish weren\u2019t considered White, but today they are. There\u2019s some evidence that the category of Whiteness is expanding to encompass people of Latino ancestry (traditionally seen as separate from White) and even Asian ancestry. Meanwhile, even today a relatively small amount of Black ancestry causes someone to be categorized as Black by society. For example, someone with one Black grandparent and three White grandparents is likely to be categorized and identify as Black and/or mixed-race, whereas someone with one White grandparent and three Black grandparents would never be categorized as White and is even relatively unlikely to be categorized as mixed-race. Race is also seen as something genetic, heritable and immutable.\nIn Brazil, race is more fluid. It\u2019s a more based on what you look like and how you are perceived, rather than being seen as something genetic and immutable. I remember seeing a study where something like 1/8 of people changed their self-reported racial classification over the course of a few years. There\u2019s a saying that goes something like \u201cmoney makes skin Whiter\u201d \u2014 your social class impacts your perceived racial classification. There is also a bit more subtlety in terms of degrees of racial classifications. Rather than Black and White, the government officially classifies people as Black, Brown, or White (plus a few others) and most people identify as either White or Brown (roughly even split). But there\u2019s a huge richness of vocabulary and gradations of color that people use to talk about race that just dwarfs the simplistic categories used in the USA.\nAnyway, so what does this have to do with racial resentment? One major factor is that Brazil has created a national myth around the idea of being a sort of post-racial, racial democracy type of place. There\u2019s a famous book from the 1930s, Casa-Grande & Senzala (in English usually translated as The Masters and The Slaves), that was really influential in creating this type of thinking. It promoted the idea that just as Brazil had far more gradations of race due to \u201cmiscegenation\u201d, Brazil also has mixed the ancestral Portuguese, African, and Amerindian cultures into a distinctly Brazilian culture.\nBrazilian World Cup Gambling Party\nCompare that to the USA where as a society or at least in certain parts of society, there\u2019s still a lot of discomfort around accepting Black people as an integral part of the American fabric. And it is really specifically around Blackness too \u2014 remember that the \u201che\u2019s not American\u201d paranoid rhetoric around Obama wasn\u2019t due to him growing up in Indonesia, but due to him having a Kenyan father.\nGeorgia bar owner calls Obama the N-Word on a road sign again and still claims he isn\u2019t racist\nIn Brazil, discrimination against Blacks has also tended to operate at a sort of subconscious level whereas in the USA it was much more institutionalized and visible. The USA had redlining, sundown towns, poll taxes and poll tests, explicit segregation, bans on inter-racial marriage, and Jim Crow laws; most of these lasted until the 1960s de jure or even longer de facto. Brazil isn\u2019t quite the utopia of racial harmony that it is sometimes made out to be, but it has had far, far less in terms of legally enshrined discrimination.\nRace is more complicated than your question implies & Brazil has a national image around racial inclusiveness whereas whites in the USA have often enforced racial discrimination", "There\u2019s probably no chance of free money ie \u201creparations\u201d in Brazil vs the USA.

Q., 10.10.41\nArmy Command 6., Sec. Ia-A. 7\nSubject: Conduct of Troops in Eastern Territories.\nRegarding the conduct of troops towards the bolshevistic sys-tem, vague ideas are still prevalent in many cases. The most essential aim of war against the Jewish-bolshevistic system is a complete destruction of their means of power and the elimina- tion of asiatic influence from the European culture. In this connection the troops are facing tasks which exceed the onesided routine of soldiering. The soldier in the eastern territories is not merely a fighter according to the rules of the art of war but also a bearer of ruthless national ideology and the avenger of bestialities which have been inflicted upon German and racially related nations.\nTherefore the soldier must have full understanding for the necessity of a severe but just revenge on subhuman Jewry. The Army has to aim at another purpose, i. e., the annihilation of revolts in hinterland which, as experience proves, have always been caused by Jews.\nThe combating of the enemy behind the front line is still not being taken seriously enough. Treacherous, cruel partisans and unnatural women are still being made prisoners of war and guerilla fighters dressed partly in uniforms or plain clothes and vagabonds are stiil being treated as proper soldiers, and sent to prisoner of war camps. In fact, captured Russian officers talk even mockingly about Soviet agents moving openly about the roads/ and very often eating at German field kitchens. Such an attitude of the troops can only be explained by complete thought-lessness, so it is now high time for the commanders to clarify the meaning of the present struggle.\nThe feeding of the natives and of prisoners of war who are not working for the Armed Forces from Army kitchens is an equally misunderstood humanitarian act as is the giving of cigarettes and bread. Things which the people at home can spare under great sacrifices and things which are being brought by the Command to the front under great difficulties, should not be given to the enemy by the soldier not even if they originate from booty. It is an important part of our supply.\nWhen retreating the Soviets have often set buildings on fire. The troops should be interested in extinguishing of fires only as far as it is necessary to secure sufficient numbers of billets. Otherwise the disappearance of symbols of the former bolshevistic rule even in the form of buildings is part of the struggle of destruction. Neither historic nor artistic considerations are of any importance in the eastern territories. The command issues the necessary directives for the securing of raw materials and plants, essential for war economy. The complete disarming of the civil population in the rear of the fighting troops is imperative considering the long and vulnerable lines of communications. Where possible, captured weapons and ammunition should be stored and guarded. Should this be impossible because of the situation of the battle so the weapons and ammunition will be rendered useless. If isolated partisans are found using firearm in the rear of the army drastic measures are to be taken. These measures will be extended to that part of the male population who were in a position to hinder or report the attacks. The indifference of numerous apparently anti-soviet elements which originates from a \"wait and see\" attitude, must give way to a clear decision for active collaboration. If not, no one can com-plain about being judged and treated a member of the Soviet System.\nThe fear of the German counter-measures must be stronger than the threats of the wandering bolshevistic remnants. Being far from all political considerations of the future the soldier has to fulfill two tasks:\n1. Complete annihilation of the false bolshevistic doctrine of the Soviet State and its armed forces.\n2. The pitiless extermination of foreign treachery and cruelty and thus the protection of the lives of military personnel in Russia.\nThis is the only way to fulfil our historic task to liberate the German people once forever from the Asiatic-Jewish danger.\nCommander in Chief\n(Signed) von Reichenau\nField Marshal.\nCertified Copy :", "The Wehrmacht was never exactly cuddly at any point, but accepted norms were generally observed up to the launch of Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the USSR) in June of \u201841.

By making the range for getting an A smaller, kids will learn that small details matter and to always check their work. They will learn to work and finish everything to the best of their ability.\nI can also provide some insight on the second step because I am studying right now in 8th grade. We need to stop throwing facts at kids to memorize. We have to allow kids to think for themselves and be creative. We live in an entrepreneurial society where people who come up with creative ideas and implement them help our society progress. Studies show that after their time in school, kids are much less creative. Why? Because they were taught to memorize facts instead of using logic and a things they previously learned to deduce something new. In mathematics they memorize formulas and never ask themselves where the formula came from. In the sciences kids learn Biology and Chemistry but never see how the two subjects are related. They never make connections from one class to another. I\u2019ve had classmates who could tell me the exact dates of the events that led to the Revolutionary War but couldn\u2019t make an argument for why it happened.\nThere is a simple fix to this.\nTest kids on their creativity and their ability to use prior knowledge. For example, on a geometry test put a theorem kids have never learned before and ask them to prove it. Give them plenty of time to think. Then grade easy even if they were unable to complete the task. Sure, kids should still learn to memorize things, but the creativity is important as well.", "You\u2019re going to love this:\nLet.

One of the key points of the book is that the fate of Rome was tied inextricably to fluctuations of the climate and to outbreaks of disease. For example the battle of Adrianople in 378 AD is regarded as one of Rome\u2019s worst military defeats ever. At Adrianople the Romans lost an estimated 20,000 men and the Goths pushed their way into the Empire. It was a disaster for Rome that it never recovered from, but it came at the end of two centuries of plague, deteriorating climate, and economic contraction.\nThe Antonine Plague:\nThe Antonine Plague was the first pandemic in history and it happened because the Romans created a world in which pandemic became possible. Cities with dense populations connected by highly trafficked trade links bringing in goods and people from all over the world made the Mediterranean a vast petri dish waiting for something deadly to fall into. In 165 AD something did.\nStarting in 165 AD the Antonine plague is estimated to have killed 7,000,000 in the first years that it hit the empire (165\u2013180 AD). It could have been measles but it was probably smallpox. It showed up in the cities of the Middle East and was probably carried by the Roman Army and by merchants throughout the Empire.\nAccording to the Roman historian Dio Cassius\n(155\u2013235), when the disease returned to Rome in 177 AD it caused up to 2,000 deaths a day in Rome and had a mortality rate of about 25% The total number of deaths in this first wave have been estimated at 15 million. With the disease killing as much as one-third of the population in some areas and devastating the Roman army.\nWhat's worse, is that there wasn\u2019t just one hit and then it was over. The plague would burn through one location. Then radiate out from there to other cities and the countryside as people tried to flee from it and carried it with them. Because of the slower travel times this dispersal and radiation of the disease took decades to play out.\nAfter 165 AD there was always plague going on in the Empire. Including an outbreak that was especially severe known as the Plague of Cyprian\nthat ran from 251\u2013ca. 270. The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure to this disease, so they were in essence \u201cvirgin field\u201d epidemics.\nFinally in 541 AD, the first great pandemic of Yersina pestis, or bubonic plague struck the Mediterranean. It too was devastating and it would linger for more than two centuries. Three major waves of plague that over a 500 year period caused a decline in population of about 50%.\nClimate Change:\nThe Empire\u2019s most prosperous period, it is generally agreed, was between 96 and 180 AD. That period, when the Roman project was at its most healthy \u2014 also coincided with the Roman Climate Optimum, which ran from about 200 BC to 150 AD. This was a period when the weather warmed up.\nPliny the Elder, writing in the first century AD, described how beech trees, which used to grow only in the lowlands, started climbing up mountains as the temperature rose. Olives and vines were grown further and further north. The Empire became a giant greenhouse. Agricultural output was high, food was plentiful and cheap, the population increased rapidly and reached a high in the Mediterranean basin of around 75 million during this period.\nThis period ended around 150 AD when climate conditions started deteriorating. Known as the \u2018Roman Transitional Period\u2019 the climate got progressively cooler year after year for the next 250 years. Culminating in the \u2018Late Antique Little Ice Age\u2019, from 450\u2013700 AD, when the Empire fell apart.\nThis stressed the Empire as it was being hit by the pandemics mentioned above. The changing climate increased the frequency of droughts and crop failures throughout the Empire. Which, in a vicious feedback loop, naturally increased the numbers of hungry malnourished people vulnerable to disease.\nIn Egypt in 244 AD, the Nile, a crucial agricultural source, failed to rise and irrigate neighboring fields, and was weak in the following two years. A population weakened by widespread malnutrition was vulnerable to disease and in 249 AD the Plague of Cyprian struck. Political instability fueled by hunger and depopulation led to a mini-collapse sometimes called the \u2018first fall\u2019 of the Empire.\nThe double blow of bubonic plague (541 AD) and the mini ice age, triggered by a huge volcanic eruption in the northern hemisphere, in 536 AD did the rest. By 650 AD the population of the Mediterranean basin, which had been 75 million in the 2nd century AD, collapsed to half that; Rome, once home to 1,000,000 people at its height in 150 AD, was now inhabited by only 20,000.", "Quite a few.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics", "Disease was endemic to the empire and epidemics regularly occurred.\nSee here: Disease in Imperial Rome - Wikipedia", "The Roman Empire was frequently impacted by epidemics.

When he returned he had a Triumph, but his joy was marred by the deaths of both of his youngest two sons in a plague that was ravaging the city. We don\u2019t know whether his returning soldiers brought it back from Macedonia.\nPerhaps the most significant plague in ancient times was the Antonine plague during the late second century A.D. It was highly contagious and destroyed both legions and mining camps. The effect on legions weakened Rome military and the inability to mine precious metals weakened her financially. This plague was a significant factor in the subsequent political instability and ultimate decline of the western half of the Roman Empire. We don\u2019t know what the disease was, but historians speculate that it may have been either small pox or measles.", "Yes, definitely. Perhaps the worst was an outbreak of the Black Plaque in the sixth century AD which ruined Justinian\u2019s hopes of regaining the Italian Peninsula.

Because of safety measures, some predators and other dangerous animals were killed by the zoo keepers.\nBy the end of the war, the zoo was fortified with the Zoo Tower, a huge flak tower that was one of the last remaining areas of Nazi German resistance against the Red Army, with its bunkers and anti-aircraft weapons defending against Allied air forces. At the entrance of the zoo, there was a small underground shelter for zoo visitors and keepers. During the battle, wounded German soldiers were taken care for here by female personnel and the wives of zookeepers.

After them, classical music continued to mostly be not easy to listen to, with a few exceptions like Aaron Copland\u2019s middle period, or most old-school orchestral movie scores.\nWhat you really need to do is find an online site that covers music history, and read up on the subject - this answer doesn\u2019t even approach being an adequate summary.", "At what point in history and why did the music degenerate (no more Mozart or Beethoven)?\nThe premise shows a lack of understanding of the role and production of music. There are good and less good producers of music in all time periods, but to suggest that one time period produces only good stuff and another period produces only degenerated stuff ignores the facts.\nMusic is a reflection of the time it is made and the people who listen to it. No one period or type is to be treated with idolatry. Among other things, every generation (including that of Mozart and Beethoven) has its own music which represents its growing identify and its rebellion against authority.", "Mozart and Beethoven are part of the degeneration. Consider the complexity of the High Renaissance.", "I disagree with the premise of your question. Music has always been a reflection of the time and place in which it was created. During the time of Mozart and Beethoven society was much more formal and composers were dependent upon the patronage of the nobility. Hence, music reflected their tastes.\nThe situation is much different today. It would take a book(s) to delineate the differences between the world of Mozart/Beethoven and today\u2019s musicians. Among the most important is the impact of technology. Think for a moment how victorlas, radios, televisions, cds, and online services have changed the music industry. Musicians are now able to take their music directly to a widespread audience.\nSo I return to my original thought: music is always a reflection of the time and place in which it was created. Music has not degenerated. It has evolved and surely will continue to witness the changes to our world.", "When?

Chanakya (311 BC to 283 BC), born in Pataliputra in eastern India, was the genius behind the establishment of the first pan-Indian empire.\nHe was an acharya (professor) of politics and economics in the ancient university of Takshashila. Chanakya\u2019s Arthashastra and Chanakya Neeti are more comprehensive works of statecraft and politics since the Mauryan times. He then spent the few years trying to unite Indian kingdoms against the foreign invader mainly Alexander.\nIn the two books attributed to him, Chanakya Neeti and Arthasashtra, Chanakya covers all aspects of administration. The Arthshastra is a concept of saptanga or elements of state apparatus which are as follows:\nSwami (lord/king), Amatya(ministers), janapada(territory), Durga(fortified capital), Kosha(treasury), Danda(punishment/justice) and Mitra(ally).\nChanakya/kautilya gives detailed instructions on how the palace should be provided with multiple secret emergency exits and how all things going in and out of the palace complex must be carefully examined. All good and drinks consumed by the king must be first tested. A king should have a personal guard of female archers and must surround himself with the people wh he trust. Elaborate arrangements were made to guard the king against poison, fire and snakes.\nThe Artshastra also emphasise the moral obligations of kingship by elaborating king's duties. He asks the king only to forego ethics in the times of war and against enemies. Chanakya lays strict ethical codes for administration during peace, along with an elaborate structure for social security of the weak and oppressed in Arthashastra. His morality is based on the apad dharma or the moral code during the time of crisis.\nThe paternalistic rule is reflected in Arthshastra which states that the king should behave like a father and ensure security and prosperity for his subjects. These arrangements that were made in the Mauryan statehood are the best examples of Machiavellianism.\nTherefore Chanakya was a successful politician of ancient India.

The name is merely a perspective point of view based on the continuity of identities.\nAnd while that is true, that doesn't make the name wrong, people are quick to jump and make such simplistic conclusions. The name reflects a shared identity of the Catholic Latin kingdoms of northern medieval Spain, and that identity is true.\nThe king Alfonso VI of Castile called himself \u201cEmperor of Spain\" after conquering Toledo and re-uniting Castile, Le\u00f3n and Galicia (which had briefly split). He called himself emperor of Spain, because there was a Spanish identity, you don't call yourself the emperor of a concept that doesn't exist or you don't identify with. And Spain is the Latin name of the place. So the claim that the shared identity of the northern kingdoms is a modern fabrication is completely false.\nAlfonso VI calls himself Emperor of Spain after taking Toledo and reuniting Castile, Le\u00f3n and Galicia from his brothers\nAnd there was a conflict between north and south, Latin Catholics and Muslim Moors, and the proof is the fact that the movement of the borders was north and south, not east and west. The gains and losses, the wars, were north and south. If the conflict had been in all directions, wars and borders would have moved in all directions. But every northern kingdom expanded in a vertical column south.\nThere were of course conflicts among Latin and Moorish kingdoms, because raw interests are the pulling force of politics, but that was molded by the 2 identities shared north and south, and that is shown by the fact that virtually all conflicts and border movements were in the same direction.\nIn fact, when the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba falls and Muslim Iberia splits into several small kingdoms, the stronger northern kingdoms start to gain ground against them. As they say \u201cunion makes strength\" and when the Muslims split the Catholics gained power against them, Castile specially emerged as the leading Latin-Catholic power in the peninsula for the first time.\nWhat happened? The Muslims called North African forces for help and re-united them as one kingdom under the Almoravid dynasty. The Iberian Muslim rulers were horrified by Alfonso VI conquering Toledo. The Almoravid Caliphate took over Muslim Iberia and western North Africa and launched a strike back against Castile. And Castile was pushed back and entered a deep internal crisis.\nAlmoravid Caliphate\nBut at that moment Aragon and Portugal which had remained mostly inactive during the previous period launched large scale attacks, Aragon conquered Zaragoza going from a small kingdom on the Pyrenees to one of the 3 main Catholic Iberian powers, and most importantly creating a crisis in the Almoravid Caliphate whose sole reason to exist was defeating the northern kingdoms and it was failing.\nOn top of that the Almohads in north Africa used this moment of weakness to gain power against the Almoravids, taking over their caliphate and attempting another attack back at Catholics in Iberia.\nAlmohad Caliphate\nBut this time the Catholic kingdoms also united, except the Portuguese, but Aragon, Castile and Navarra (the ones that would form Spain later) united against the Almohads. In the battle of Navas de Tolosa in southern Castile, the 3 Latin kingdoms fought the Moorish alliance in the largest battle of the Reconquista. The Muslims lost while having a big size advantage, largely thanks to the sacrifices of the orders (the Order of Santiago lost its leader fighting himself in the front), and the Navarrans who having the least to gain risked the most of the 3 kingdoms.\nPainting of the Navas de Tolosa battle\nParade of the Pend\u00f3n of Navas de Tolosa in northern Castile\nCelebrations for the Navas de Tolosa in northern Castile\nMilitary parade of the Spanish land forces in Santa Elena, the village located in the battlefield in Andalusia\nAfter the defeat of the Muslims, Castile conquered all of southern Spain except Granada, which was allowed to exist as a vassal paying money yearly to Castile. Until the sultanate of Granada attacked Castile 2 centuries later tired of the vassal status. Portugal also went on to conquer the land south of their border as the Muslim powers were collapsing.\nIberian Peninsula after the defeat of the Almohads\nAt that time Castile was in a union with Aragon through the marriage of Isabella and Ferdinand, and that was the perfect excuse Isabella needed to invade Granada. Castile and Aragon conquered Granada for Castile. Later Castile and Aragon conquered Naples for Aragon, and with that and the annexation of Navarra, Castile and Aragon acted as one for the rest of history later forming Spain.\nFerdinand of Aragon (red) and Isabella of Castile (white) in the Take of Granada the 2nd of January of 1492, Ferdinand reaches for the keys of the city handed by the sultan Boabdil, Granada becomes part of Castile after that\nThe alliances and blocks between Latin Catholics and Muslim Moors are the clearest evidence of the existance of shared identities north and south, and the northern one was inherited from the Romans, which the Visigoths themselves had borrowed.

The Gothic nobles refused to recognize his young sons and elected Roderick\n, dux (duke) of Baetica, to succeed him. Gothic Gaul\nfollowed Witiza\u2019s son Akhila, and the Basques\nrebelled. As Roderick marched north to quell the Basques, his rivals appealed to M\u016bs\u0101 ibn Nu\u1e63ayr\n, the Umayyad\ngovernor of the Maghreb\n. M\u016bs\u0101 dispatched an army under \u1e6c\u0101riq ibn Ziy\u0101d\nin late spring 711. The force landed at Gibraltar\n, crossed to mainland Spain, and in July 711 defeated Roderick\u2019s army.\nInstead of returning to North Africa\n, \u1e6c\u0101riq marched on the Visigothic capital of Toledo\nand took the city with minimal resistance. \u201c From:: Battle of Tours | Facts, History, & Importance\nDo the invaders made alliances with some locals when convenient? Yes, they did. But that does not gave them rights over other their land. Further, that was not enough for them: they wanted all. The Basques rebellion seeded the invasion. This has happened often in history, rebels become traitors in order to succeed.\nDo the invaders brought cultural values? Yes, specialty technical and artistic. Greek knowledge survived more between the Muslims than in first centuries in Europe, and they have refinement in luxuries and art, even mathematicians an astronomers. The price: they wanted to be the owners and lords.\n2] ISLAMIC ADVANCE INTO EUROPE THROUGH SPAIN:\nAs I told before, they wanted dominate all.\n\u201c Ever since their arrival in Spain\nfrom Africa in 711, Muslims had raided Frankish territory, threatening Gaul\nand on one occasion (725) reaching Burgundy and sacking Autun\n. In 732 \u02bfAbd al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n al-Ghafiqi, the governor of C\u00f3rdoba\n, marched into Bordeaux\nand defeated (Duke) Eudes. The Muslims then proceeded north across Aquitaine to the city of Poitiers. Eudes appealed to Charles for assistance, and Charles managed to defeat a significant Muslim force at the Battle of Tours\n. Although Tours is sometimes presented as a decisive check on Muslim expansion into Europe\n, it was, in reality, a single engagement in a decades-long conflict between the Franks and the armies of Muslim Spain\n\u201d (rather Muslims in Spain): From: Charles Martel | Biography, Accomplishments, & Facts\n3] MUSLIM ADVANCE STOPPED From: Battle of Tours (732 A.D.)\n:\n\u201c Battle of Tours (732 A.D.)\nThe Battle of Tours (often called the Battle of Poitiers, but not to be confused with the Battle of Poitiers, 1356) was fought on October 10, 732 between forces under the Frankish leader Charles Martel and a massive invading Islamic army led by Emir Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi Abd al Rahman, near the city of Tours, France. During the battle, the Franks defeated the Islamic army and Emir Abd er Rahman was killed. This battle stopped the northward advance of Islam from the Iberian peninsula, and is considered by most historians to be of macrohistorical importance, in that it halted the Islamic conquests, and preserved Christianity as the controlling faith in Europe, during a period in which Islam was overrunning the remains of the old Roman and Persian Empires. \u201c\n\u201c\u201d Contemporary analysis\nHad Martel fallen at Tours the long term implications for European Christianity may have been devastating. His victory there, and in the following campaigns, may have literally saved Europe and Christianity as we know it, from conquest while the Caliphate was unified and able to mount such a conquest. Had the Franks fallen, no other power existed stopping Muslim conquest of Italy and the effective end of what would become the modern Catholic Church\u2026\u2026. But had Martel failed, there would have been no Charlemagne, no Holy Roman Empire or Papal States. \u201c\u201d\n4] Conclusions: There is not doubt there was a Conquest. Perhaps it would be better they have called the liberation war a Retrieval, or just Liberation war. Of course, after eight centuries of domination, there was enough unavoidable mixing. Therefore, some inhabitants suffered a mentality change, because that was in part the Muslim goal, a mentality change through dominance, and this happens even today. Therefore, even today there are Islamist in Spain, sort of Stockholm syndrome. Personally, I admire those who fought through 8 centuries, through generations, against the imposition of a religion opposite to Catholicism, the Muslim mentality and the submission to caliphates. And I am afraid the history could repeat.", "History, like some people, sometimes has a selective memory. In the case of Spain, The Muslims \u201cconquered\u201d it from the Goths, I believe it was, who conquered it from the previous occupants who conquered it from the previous occupants.\nA similar situation occurred many times in the United States. Many of the tribes who had their land \u201cstolen\u201d by white Europeans had acquired \u201ctheir\u201d land by the same methods; theft by conquest.\nIn Spain, the Christians \u201creconquered\u201d land that they themselves had stolen initially.", "It\u2019s complicated.\nIn the early 8th century, a small army of Muslim Berbers invaded Spain and took over, deposing Roderick, the final Gothic king of Spain, in the process. In this, they were aided by a lot of local allies, who hated the king. It was partly an invasion and partly a native uprising.\nFor centuries thereafter, Spain was mostly ruled by Muslim leaders, several of immediate or recent foreign extraction, though many natives converted for better access to power and constituted part of the ruling class. The Reconquista was an effort largely on the part of the few Christian-ruled territories of northern Spain, which had not been conquered, to conquer Iberia themselves, motivated to a considerable extent by the change in dominant religion. And eventually they succeeded. Christian rulers drove out Muslim rulers.\nIn a way, the Reconquista was something of a return to the status quo ante. Spain had been ruled by Christians before, and then it came to be ruled by Christians again. On the other hand, it\u2019s difficult to characterize Ferdinand, who finished the job, as recovering anything which was rightfully his. He was no heir to Roderick. Nor was Spain \u201cstolen\u201d any more than in any other invasion and probably less than in others. To reiterate: the Muslim invasion had local support. Muslims didn\u2019t come in and slaughter or enslave all the Christians. Muslims came in and established themselves as a ruling class with the aid of other Christians. And, of course, neither Christianity nor the Church owned Spain, so they certainly couldn\u2019t have it stolen from them or recovered. Christian military figures restored rule by Christians, but that\u2019s as far as I\u2019d go."], "topic_list": ["Reconquista", "History of Spain", "Warfare", "Military History and Wars", "History"], "view_list": [420, 177, 27, 359], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Thao Dao", "upvote_list": [19, 1, 0, 26], "question_title": "Could the Reconquista actually be considered taking back stolen lands or was it just a normal war?", "respond_collected": 4, "no_of_view": "1,221", "name_list": ["Lucas Villar", "Fernando L.

The Operation Unthinkable seems to have been very much a cautionary tale, to sober anyone - and there were such people in the UK - who wanted to continue WWII but against the Soviets.\nBy the end of WWII in Europe, by the end of the Yalta conference, there was considerable thought that the Soviet Union was not going to be a civilized and friendly power with the UK and the US and the rest of the world in the post-war world. These people were not entirely wrong, as Soviet post-war actions would show.\nThe Soviet Union, recall, had not been a friendly place between the wars, but had worked to sponsor revolutions in Europe and had worked to subvert Western governments. Soviet spies were active, and in subversion, not just intelligence gathering. Even the Soviet participation in the Spanish Civil War had been marked by brutality and activity against other parties supporting the Republic against Franco. And many people knew just how Stalin\u2019s government ran the Soviet Union.\nSo there were quite a few people in the UK before 1939 who were in favor of rapprochement with Nazi Germany to oppose the Soviet Union, even to the point of armed attack. Remember the UK had supported armed action against the Soviet government during the collapse of the Czarist government and after WWI; the adventures of Sidney Rielly were not all fiction.\nThe UK was not alone in this opposition. The Poles, who had fought a Russian attack after WWI - that is how Pilsudski came on the scene - hated and feared the Russians so much that Poland would not agree to allowing Russian troops to cross Poland to fight Germany. The Russian actions after their non-aggression pact with the Germans showed the Poles were at least partly right - the Russians occupied part of Poland, in cooperation with the Nazis, and murdered thousands of Polish officers and otherbZpoles in the Katyn Forest. The Soviet treatment of the Polish government in exile was further example of Soviet policy continuing Imperial Russian policy of imperial control of Poland. The Baltic states were of the same mind, as they, too, had been parts of the Czar\u2019s empire. And they all had the example of Finland, another part of the Czar\u2019s empire, before them. The Soviet Union wanted (and after 1945, mostly got) the real estate back.\nBeing anti-Soviet was the idea of the Hungarian regime, and of Romania, too. The Austrians were not unhappy about joining Nazi Germany in a opposition to Russia. They had all seen a Communist uprising in Bavaria in 1919 - and Hungary had seen Bela Kun.\nHow many people from Nazi occupied Europe and neutral nations joined the SS and went to fight the Russians ? Do you remember who the SS troops defending the Furher bunker in Berlin in 1945 were ? They weren\u2019t German - they were French.\nThe Catholic Church agreed with the Nazis about opposition to the Soviets. Pope Pius had been the legate in Bavaria, and had seen the same Communist uprising everyone else in the area had - but he had been ringside. Anti-Soviet unity was the idea of the German-Vatican Concordat; you might note, the silence of the Vatican about Nazi Germany during the war. Hitler paid his church tax to the Catholic Church throughout the war (and the Church took the money), and the Church never moved to excommunicate Hitler or any other Nazi.\nThere were, in the UK and before 1939, people, some very influential, who agreed with these Europeans that the Soviet Union was an enemy, one to be opposed and possibly fought, in alliance with Germany, Nazi or not. This was, if I understand correctly, the view of the Cliveden set, and maybe more than a few in Parliament and maybe the view of the abdicated King, now the Duke of Windsor.\nRemember that Churchill had been one of the forces behind the British intervention against the Soviet regime in 1919. The Churchill joke about allying with the Devil and making favorable remarks in the House of Commons about him if Satan would fight Hitler was not exactly complimentary to the Soviet Union.\nThese people in the UK did not change their minds about the Soviet Union because of the trivial matter of WWII.\nRemember, too, that making peace with England and turning the war against the Soviet Union in alliance with England was a chimera that the German opposition to Hitler had and, within the German Army, continued to have until the very end of the war in Europe. Exactly that idea was not confined to the German opposition to Hitler. Hitler himself thought the alliance between England and Russia was preposterous and impossible as a lasting one, and that the death of Roosevelt could be the catalyst for breaking the Allies up - and turning them against the Soviet Union by the side of the Germans.That idea seems to have been on Rudolf Hess\u2019 mind when he flew to England, and was the idea both Himmler and Goebbels had for their peace overtures in 1945.\nSo, with such an idea having swirled around for so long, Churchill, who knew the British could not stand to continue any Continental war much longer, asked what making an anti-Russian alliance with Germany and joining the war against the Soviet Union and winning that war would actually cost and require.\nSo he asked, and asked for a military plan for doing so, fighting and defeating the Soviet Union in 1945, with at least part of his reasons for doing so being able to show it in case someone who had to be answered (Lord Halifax, for example) raised the question.\nShowing the plan would enable Churchill to reply \u201c\u201cDo you think we can do this ? This is the best plan we have to fight the Soviet Union and winter. Do you think we have the strength to do this ? Do you think the British people, having been at war since 1939, have the strength and will to do this ? Do you think the Canadians will go along with this ? Do you think the Americans will come along ? Do you think the Americans would even continue Lend Lease for this ?\u201d\nOf course there is one other thought. Many people in England and in the US distrusted the Soviet Union so much that they considered the Russians might not stop their attack through Europe with the defeat of Germany but might, just might, continue on across Germany and France and everyone else, all the way to the sea, fighting the British and Americans and everyone else.

The first was to attack the Soviet forces to enforce the Yalta agreement about Poland. Churchill was very bitter abut saving the Poles from the Germans only to turn them over to the Soviets, but he had to accept the reality of the situation. It was quickly determined that such a plan would be a disastrous failure and was scrapped.\nThe second was a defensive plan for the West if the Soviets continued their push into Western Europe.

Despite the theoretical absolute power of the Emperor, this was not de facto true since men who went beyond what the aristocracy were ready to accept tended to be assassinated. If this was not so, any unpopular reforms would be repudiated when a new Emperor ascended the throne. The reforms of Sulla and Diocletian are examples of this.\nThe problem in Rome was not the individual merits of Emperors or Dictators, but rather the inherent greed and corruption in the ruling class. The first death blow of Rome was the Marian reforms, changing the army from landed citizens serving in a militia capacity, to that of a professional army paid by the State and populated by the landless poor and foreigners. Before this change it would scarcely be possible for a general to usurp the Republic and proclaim himself absolute ruler, as Sulla and Caesar did. And the main reason for that change was the continuous campaigning in the Late Republic, impoverishing the farmer citizen who made up the bulk of the army, forcing their families to sell their properties to the aristocracy. The attempt to enact land reform to solve this problem was met with fierce resistance from the Senatorial class. The Gracchi brothers and Julius Caesar met their deaths due to these confrontations.\nLater this same tendency started to jeopardize the taxable income from the provinces, since the landed elite bribed the governors to avoid paying their fair share of tax. To meet their quotas, the pressure instead fell on the regular farmers, which impoverished them also and causing a decline in State income. Diocletian tried to counteract this by creating a system which later became the Feudal System, forcing the son to continue the line of work of his father, and setting fixed amounts for the amount of tax and produce to be paid by region. This meant that the combination of corruption and the occasional bad harvest would bankrupt the farmers, and if their sons had sense, to simply flee their stipulated duty to work. Draconian measures to uphold the system using the sword had little real effect for this reason. You can not force a man to do a job he knows will cause his doom long term.\nJulian the Apostate demonstrated that the necessary funds could easily be collected if the governor was conscientious and thorough in his work, but rulers like him were extremely rare, and ultimately the endemic corruption and decline in production and income meant that a professional army of sufficient size could no longer be maintained.

Among books that age, that portion of the Old Testament is about as accurate as books of that age get. However, the Old Testament makes some fantastic claims. Throughout the history of Christianity disbelief in the veracity and the literality of these stories has been relatively common in Christianity.\nHistorically there have been two schools of thought on the subject that date back to the inception of the Church. The Antiochian school held that the Old Testament was a literal document, and Adam and Eve were historical people. St. John Chrysostom was one of the most famous figures in this school. The Alexandrian School, on the other hand, took a more allegorical approach to the Old Testament. Questions about the literality and the veracity of the bible are as old as the bible is itself. However, doubt is a part of faith.", "Yes.

I believe that\u2019s intentional as it lends credibility to the idea that the events that occur that are magnificent and impossible to fathom in today\u2019s society because the surrounding text is proven fact.\nYes there are things that you have to take by faith when reading the Bible but when has that ever been a problem for people? Because the Bible makes the claim that there is one true, all-powerful God and he did incredible things (which would make sense, since he\u2019d be GOD) people have a hard time coming to grips with it. That is true of many other texts, which were written by victors of war or the privileged in a struggling world. What makes the Bible different in that sense is that much of it is not written out of victory. There are incredible stories of people that in-fact lived in this world that have incredible meaning/significance when read carefully. The Old Testament also serves as a cornerstone to our distant history.\nI personally believe every word the Bible says because it explains a LOT that no other religious text or human-generated belief system seems to be capable of answering. It has mankind\u2019s origins, development, morality and more wrapped up in an exhausting number of \u201cbooks\u201d. The Bible is not some continuous book, either.

The Dr. Ravi Zacharias does a magnificent job, with a few friends at times, describing the Bible\u2019s authenticity and how it must be found true through reasoning and logical deductions. A lot of intellectuals think that the Bible and God are feeling-based entities when they\u2019re both that AND intellectual.

In other words, those writers were not telling history but stories in the context of their own time.\nIn conclusion, the Torah gives extremely good information on the historical context around the time of their writing ( from the 7th century BCE) but what is described as historical before that time is just fables, around some maybe existing old figures as David who was just a tribal leader ( and no king).\n\nReference: The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts by Neil Asher Silberman and Israel Finkelstein", "Hardly.

There is as Gil Yehuda very rightly points out no such thing as an accurate historical text. Hence I feel safe in my assertion that the books that make up this bibliograph are not one.\nThere is insight to be gained to be sure. And indeed comparing the Jewish account to Babylonian, Egyptian. Persian, Abyssinian, Macedonian, Sumerian, and Akkadian sources can be quite informative.\nFor instances geologists and social scientists have concluded by the clearly parallel account of Noah in Genesis of a Great Flood, and that of the Akkadian-Babylonian epic the En\u00fbma Eli\u0161\nas well as geologic evidence for Ur and surrounding areas that a flood of vast proportions (though not as universal as either epic would apply) almost certainly did occur in that region.\nIn my mind any sort of record of this sort, religious or otherwise, must be viewed in the context of its time and period and should be viewed from that hermeneutical lens.", "Not a chance.", "It is provably false.

From those struggles comes the fundamental ideas of liberalism and its championing of the supreme political value, liberty (which can actually mean a lot of different things to different people). So, with this, people are not the monarch\u2019s property, nor does he (or sometimes she) therefore possess a divine right to rule over them and, as under the divine right of kings, accountable only to God in the manner of this rule. Instead, the monarch rules through the people\u2019s consent as obedient to the rule of law.\nAnd from that came the affirmation of those principles of individual liberty and rights: individual rights to trial by jury, due process, and equality before the law, including that sense of individual autonomy defined by non-interference by the ruling authorities\u2014this is the classical liberalist definition of liberty: freedom from coercion or interference in acting (i.e., negative liberty), and as esp. linked to, therefore, to the commitment of private property ownership under two rationales: 1.) as the means to live your own life (the \u201ca man\u2019s home is his castle\u201d defense\u2014a legally inviolate place of privacy, at least not without strict legal proceduralism otherwise) and 2.) as the dispersing of power relations as defending a growing free-market, capitalist economy. This is Adam Smith\u2019s famous adage that England was a \u201cnation of shopkeepers\u201d in the sense that it is \u201ca nation whose government is influenced by shopkeepers.\u201d (Wealth of Nations, Bk. 4, ch. 7).\nThis conception of liberty as private property secured by a market order began to be challenged starting in the later 19th and into the 20th centuries as capitalist economies came to be dominated by large corporations with the resultant increase in concentration of economic, market and financial power (Smith\u2019s own adage about shopkeepers was also meant to be a bulwark against accumulations of private power as well. Smith was not well-disposed toward corporations, in his day the \u201cjoint-stock company\u201d\u2014and its monopoly power).\nThe American economic landscape was no longer (as) supportive of the dominant ideal of the smaller commercial entrepreneur, let alone the Jeffersonian ideal of the yeoman farmer whose material self-sufficiency could inform a true republican polity, as too many peoples\u2019 material livelihoods were now dependent on this now dominant form of capitalist employment and what was seen as growing inequality of private power. This is all the more problematic when this capitalism, given its inherent dynamical quality, enters into one of its periodic difficulties or crises that produce high levels of unemployment with its resulting negative social consequences\u2014and made more problematic by the spread of mass democracy and the spread of political enfranchisement. Classical liberalism\u2019s ability to secure a stable and free society is now under doubt as negative liberty of non-interference doesn\u2019t mean much here with mass unemployment and as having no income severely erodes one\u2019s autonomy. What you want is positive liberty\u2014the actual ability to act and accomplish positive goals (like feeding and housing yourself) and not just to be left alone.\nThis had become palpable with the Great Depression and this is where FDR comes in and why he is seen as the embodiment of this redefined liberalism that had been building since the later 1800s. What the New Deal enacted from this massive economic fallout was this transition from the earlier classical liberalism to a greater social welfare liberalism that is still with us today, though its greatest dominance and influence was from the 1930s through the 1960s. This liberalism extended various protections of individual autonomy through things like Social Security, the FDIC, the minimum wage, unemployment insurance, etc.\u2014including the right for workers to form unions (i.e., collectivizing labor as a countervailing measure against those large collectivizations of capital known as corporations)\u2014and as part of that tradition, later Civil Rights. Even prior to the Reagan Revolution, the government\u2019s own economic policies as expressed through the Federal Reserve and the 1946 Employment Act was in this social liberalism direction: to prioritize full-employment in the goal to promote employment and fight inflation\u2014though the act fell short in asserting that people have a right to a job (with the Reagan Revolution these two principles\u2019 priorities are reversed giving us the neoliberal capitalism of today).", "He introduced \u201cNew Deal\u201d which guaranteed four freedoms, one of which is freedom from hunger. He had taxed the rich capitalists and tried to redistribute the wealth equitably.", "In my opinion classical liberalism promoted Individual Freedom to pursue personal objectives, and nothing more.\nFDR added to this with support systems as public goods and services: Social Security, Minimum Wage, Protected Unions, Workmen\u2019\u2019s Comp, etc. FDIC insurance to make banking safer, Government home loan mortgages, and rural electrification. (Eisenhower added government subsidized SBA loans, Johnson added Medicare, and somewhere along the way, government guaranteed student loans and grants.)\nClassical liberals and libertarians disparage these programs as \u201cthe nanny state,\u201d and believe these programs somehow reduce freedom.\nFDR also pledged America to create a world of The Four Freedoms. Classical liberals and conservatives take issue with two of these freedoms: Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear. They do not believe such freedoms should exist at the Government level. Classical Liberals and libertarians also take issue with America Guaranteeing these Freedoms everywhere in the world because \u201cFreedom is not Fee.\u201d\n\u201cIn the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.\nThe first is freedom of speech and expression\u2014everywhere in the world.\nThe second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way\u2014everywhere in the world.\nThe third is freedom from want\u2014which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants\u2014everywhere in the world.\nThe fourth is freedom from fear\u2014which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor\u2014anywhere in the world.\nThat is no vision of a distant millennium.\nIt is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation.\nThat kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb.\n\u2014\nFranklin D.

The Czechoslovak delegation offered Hungary the creation of an autonomous Hungarian territory within Czechoslovakia, offered to cede Great Rye Island (Zitny ostrov / Csall\u00f3k\u00f6z, 1838 km\u00b2, with 105,418 inhabitants of whom an overwhelming majority were Hungarians), the creation of a free Danube port in the town of Kom\u00e1rno, and a population exchange in the remaining frontier regions.

Some delegates proposed to use the Hungarian census from 1880 as a compromise, but it also showed a Slovak majority in the aforementioned town, and the proposal was turned down. Hungary also requested a plebiscite for Slovaks and Ruthenians about rejoining Hungary which would be a violation of Czechoslovakia\u2019s sovereignty. A few days later the Hungarian delegates declared that the negotiations had failed and asked Germany and Italy to be the adjudicator. On the same day, Horthy ordered partial mobilization.
