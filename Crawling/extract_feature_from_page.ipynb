      "Where others, whom I have seen answer here, have been falling towards theory in mathematics and physics, I will take the Natural Philosophy approach and completely, logically, and reasonably, explain what space “is” in a Platonic retroductionist methodology. This answer content comes from another answer I gave dealing with the detection of a “new space”.\n",
      "It begins here:\n",
      "The area of research needed to understand this question, much less any coherent answer to it, is going to be ancient Greek natural philosophy. Especially in the area of conjugate relationships. Space and matter are indeed conjugates. They both define each other necessitatively so. However, one of them, even if defined, is going to be the absolute opposite of what is defining it. We will start with matter.\n",
      "How do we denotatively define matter? This question fundamentally is asking: ‘How do we prove we experience the universe we exist within?’. Our experience may exist only within our brains however we obtain this experience through our senses.\n",
      "We have a few “properties” of our experience we must consider if we are to make sense of what it is we need to know. These properties give spatial dimensionality to what is being perceived. If we take a simple ball as an example, we can observe that the ball affects our senses of observation (i.e. our 5 senses).\n",
      "When we hold the ball, we can “feel” a sensation of rigidity and malleability. It feels “solid”. So our sense of touch is one proof. We can physically direct our eyes to the ball and see the EM perturbations (i.e. light) reflected from it. So our sense of sight is another proof. If we sniff the ball, we can smell the distinct scent of the material which makes up the ball. So our sense of smell is yet another proof. If we release the ball and allow it to fall down to the ground, we will hear noise as a result of contact of the ball with the ground. Our sense of sound is a proof. If, before we drop the ball to the floor, we bring it to our mouth and take a bite on it, we will taste the distinct flavor of the material of the ball. Most likely it will taste like rubber. But nonetheless, we will be able to taste “something”. So sense of taste is a proof.\n",
      "So, empirically, all of our five senses have been used to quite literally prove we are able to detect “something” that we are labeling as a ball. It may be that we have only proven it to ourselves but who else needs proving to in this case when others with intact sensory inputs will detect near-identical phenomena.What we have detected is what we philosophically label “spatial” phenomena. An event that occurs at a location in the expanse of our experience that interacts to our sensory input organs. This is one side of the coin of conjugates. Now for the other side: space.\n",
      "In order to understand what “space” is we start by understanding what it is not. Space is not:\n",
      "1.) Magnitude\n",
      "2.) Volume\n",
      "3.) Direction\n",
      "4.) Mass\n",
      "5.) Density\n",
      "6.) momentum\n",
      "7.) Inertia\n",
      "8.) Acceleration\n",
      "9.) Force\n",
      "10.) Any other spatial property.\n",
      "And then we can denotatively define space as: The absence of dimensionality or spatial quality. As illumination is to shadow, spatial dimensionality is to counter-spatial (opposite to spatial) privation. Space has no physical property by which it can “be”. What ever may be objectively measured will always “occupy” empty space and give absence it’s definition by existence of dimensionality.\n",
      "Space in this logical deduction must be defined and proven as true as a direct result of the objective existence of phenomena which has properties of dimensionality. Spatial defines counter-spatial and counter-spatial defines spatial. Without one, the other cannot be defined. This is the essence of a conjugate relationship. However in the case of spatial vs counter-spatial, we must understand that counter-spatial phenomena are not real in the same sense that spatial is real. We cannot sense absence with our senses. And so we know that the conjugate to spatial dimensionality is a cognitive conjugate. A concept for understanding what we experience.\n",
      "We have now, rationally and logically, through natural philosophy, come to a conclusion on “what” spatial and counter-spatial means and what ultimately defines them both. Matter and space are defined and proven by virtue of each other.\n",
      "So the quote ends here and you should now have an understanding of space and how it is defined in Natural Philosophy. You will get many connotations of space in mathematics and physics. But the true understanding is in the nature of conjugates as explained here. Let no one fool you into believing a privation can be a spatial phenomena.\n",

In Science, we are required to define the crucial terms that make or break our arguments before we use them in a sentence. The physicist has to provide black and white, yes or no, on or off types of definitions so that the crowd can follow his train of thought. The crisper the definitions, the easier will be his theory on the minds of his listeners.\n",

What is perplexing is that no one on Earth has ever realized the need to define this sine qua non term. Not a single book of so-called ‘physics’ ever written begins with a definition of this enigmatic word.

They include: a. something you can name, b. a noun, c. the subject of a sentence, d. something you can talk about, etc. None of their proposals have anything to do with Physics. It’s all circular reasoning that results from sentence analysis founded in turn on the fact that the philosophers never begin their dissertations by defining the word they are going to analyze.\n",

All objects i.e. most fundamental particles, planets, stars, galaxies, black holes, pulsars, neutron stars, need space to exists. Nothing can exist without space. There is vacuum in space. Space itself is empty. It is eternal. It does not have its center or boundary. Dimensions are directions. There is no east-west, north-south or up-down in space. There is no sunrise or sunset in space. There is no change in space and as such there is no time in space. There is no grid of points in space. We cannot apply x ,y and z to space. We cannot locate points in space if we do not take use of objects in the universe. All events take place in space. Nothing in the universe can warp, bend, distort or expand space. It is neutral. It is something and it exists. We do not know its extent. It may contain multiverses. It is not curved. It is not like the surface of the Earth. Einstein thought of space as surface of the Earth and then applied time as 4th dimension. The Earth is an object, not space. X, Y AND Z are applicable to objects only, not to space.

And, finally, space may be conceived also with respect to the totality of landscape elements, i.e. the system expressed by the term “synergic”. It is only this third variant of space which should be understood as the “geographical space” in the full menaing of the term. It is only this conception of geographical space as the space filled with qualities in relations and proportions that is considered as one of the basic prerequisites for the formulation of the theory of geography as science capable of prediction and thus also of practical utilization.\n",

This is going to be a heavy lift for most, so please bear with me. Here is what we can know.\n",
      "Space is an unknowable. Time is likewise an unknowable Any attempt to define either (of and by themselves) is an impossibility. However, by linking them together, something changes. Instead of just having two unknowables, we now have a third unknowable. However, it differs from the 2 unknowables of which it is comprised, because of its potential to manifest as a plurality, depending upon which unknowable is seen to precede the other within mind. In other words, 'place' can be characterized as space-time or time-space without violating the unknowability upon which the validity of all 3 rest. It is the movement between the two faces of 'place' that establishes dichotomy, the foundation upon which relativity rests -- or equal and opposite possibility that reduces to nothing that is knowable and hence deniable when contrasted against each other. It is also an affinity for one or the other (space-time or time-space) that gives cause for one's affinity for quantity over quality or idealism over realism or objectivity over subjectivity. But regardless of which form of 'place' one chooses, everything we make difference between is comprised of a succession of \"places\" that are consistent to it. It is these mechanics that constitute the dynamics of linear quantitative thought by which our world of limitation comes to be of relevance to us.\n",

Space is usually thought to begin at the lowest altitude at which satellites can maintain orbits for a reasonable time without falling into the atmosphere. This is approximately 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the surface. Astronomers may speak of interplanetary space (the space between planets in our solar system), interstellar space (the space between stars in our galaxy), or intergalactic space (the space between galaxies in the universe). Some scientists believe that space extends infinitely far in all directions, while others believe that space is finite but unbounded, just as the 2-space surface of the earth has finite area yet no beginning nor end.\n",
      "If you mean mathematics then space is an unbounded continuum (unbroken set of points) in which exactly three numerical coordinates are necessary to uniquely define the location of any particular point. It is sometimes called 3D space because it contains three distance dimensions. If a continuum requires fewer or more than three coordinates (dimensions) to uniquely define the location of a point, that continuum is sometimes called n-space or n-dimensional space, where n is the number of dimensions. Thus, for example, a line constitutes 1-space and a plane constitutes 2-space.

If all energy were evenly distributed throughout the Universe, it would be no different than what we assume the Universe looked like at the moment of creation. The inclusion of forces created disparity in how energy existed and the “gaps” that resulted we call empty space. As energy becomes more concentrated, such as in super clusters, clusters, galaxies, and solar systems, the shift from an entropic state of the Universe becomes more pronounced, increasing the amount of “empty space”.

      "Contrary to common belief, outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard vacuum containing a very, very low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium. It is so low that the plasma between galaxies has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre. It also contains electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. Local concentrations of this plasma ultimately condenses into stars and galaxies. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the Universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.\n",
      "There is no definite altitude above the Earth's surface where outer space begins. However, the Kármán line, at an altitude of 100 km (62 miles) above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping.\n",

Microgravityalso has a negative effect on human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss.

      "The space has two attributes which are not independent of each other. These are like ocean and its waves. The infinite indivisible spiritual space and the finite material space are the two attributes of the space. Spirit is materially nothing and is perfectly motionless like the ocean without boundary. The Spirit apparently divides into discreet quanta of spirit which physicists call energy which is always in waves and has a non zero ground state value. Lot has been said about the material space by physicists. Similarly lot has been said about Spiritual space in Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita (3139 BCE). This Spiritual space is known as Brahman in Vedanta and energy of material space is called Sakti. Brahman and Sakti are not independent of each other like ocean and its waves. Material space can be seen with the two physical eyes of the observer and the spiritual space can be seen with third eye also called spiritual eye or the divine eye which becomes functional after evolution of the human over many cycles of birth and death.\n",

      "(BG13:12 to 17) I shall tell you that which has to be known, knowing which one attains immortality; it is the beginningless supreme Brahman, which is said to be neither being nor non being. With hands and feet everywhere, with ears everywhere, with eyes, heads and faces everywhere, it rests pervading everything in this world. It is manifest in the functions of various sense organs, yet bereft of all sense organs, unattached yet sustaining everything, without attributes yet the protector of qualities. It is without and within all beings, It is moving and unmoving, being subtle, It is incomprehensible. It is far, yet near. It is undivided in beings and yet remains as if divided; that knowable is the sustainer of beings as also the destroyer and creator. It is the Light of lights and is said to be beyond all darkness, It is the knowledge, the knowable and accessible through knowledge, and is implanted in the heart of all beings.\n",

      "Modern cosmology has no clear answer to the question: what is space? Debates concerning the nature of space date back 3000 years ago to the Greek philosophers Timaeus and Socrates. This topic was reformulated in the 17th century particularly during the early development of classical mechanics. It started as a philosophical debate between Leibnitz and Clarke during the years 1715 and 1716. Two opposing views regarding space were raised. One was argued by Leibniz, who claimed that space is merely the spatial relation between real things in the Universe. This means that space would not exist undependably from the things. In other words, remove the real things from the Universe and space would not exist. This view is called relationism. Clarke argued the opposing view. He claimed that space is a sort of a substance that exists everywhere. Space contains all the things in the Universe: stars, planets, Galaxies, etc. The entire Universe is moving through space that is absolute. This view is called absolutism.\n",
      "Newton took part in this debate. He argued that that absolutism was the correct view and that the Universe should have a center. At this center the group density of the stars is maximal, and as we proceed outwards of this center, the group density of the stars decreases until finally at great distances, it is succeeded by an infinite region of emptiness. In other words, the Universe is a finite island in an infinite ocean of space. Newton, in 1718, suggested that the infinite space was filled with an aether that serves as a fixed frame in the Universe. People argued against this concept because it leads to the result that light emitted by the stars and also individual stars are perpetually passing into the infinite space, never to return. Such a finite material Universe should be destined to become impoverished. Modern cosmologists abandoned Newton’s theory. Specifically, because of an experiment done, in 1887, by Michelson-Morley that showed that light was traveling at the same velocity no matter in what direction it was moving. This fact proved that there is no reference frame in the Universe, so Newton was wrong.\n",
      "Einstein related to this debate. In 1905 he published his Special Relativity that did not need the existence of aether. However, this debate has not been solved, because another experiment done by Sagnac in 1913, showed contrary to the M-M experiment that there is an aether. Einstein himself did not abound the concept of the aether. Einstein, in 1920, said: “According to the general theory of relativity space without aether is unthinkable.”\n",
      "I conquer with Newton’s view that space (or aether) is a real substance that has physical parameters and that space is infinite and permeates everywhere. The following are known facts that can prove that space has physical parameters:\n",
      "Since Maxwell published his equations, it was known that space has measurable physical parameters: permittivity and permeability. These parameters are used to calculate the speed of light in space.\n",
      "Some experiments show that space is a substance:\n",
      "1) In 1948 Casimir conducted a test that showed that space (total vacuum) could exert a force on two parallel metal plates. The accepted explanation for the Casimir effect is that space is not empty but instead filled with various fields and virtual particles.\n",
      "2) In 2011 a test named Gravity Probe B was published. In this experiment space dragging around Earth, that was predicted by GR, was proven to be correct. This means that space is a real substance that has intrinsic properties. After all, if space was nothing, there were noting to drag.\n",
      "I postulate a new theory “The Pivot Universe”. The Pivot theory describes in general, a Universe that resembles Newton’s Universe, i.e., it is an isolated island in an infinite space and has a fixed center in space. However, to explain cosmological observations, it combines Newton’s Universe and Einstein’s GR. Such a structure could not be imagined by Newton, because his gravitational law did not take into consideration the fact that all bodies in the Universe spin and drag space around them. According to this theory, I postulate that space has an additional physical parameter – viscosity. The space viscosity parameter explains how celestial bodies drag space and why in our Universe the speed of light has an upper limit.\n",
      "The interested reader can find an explanation to my claim that space has viscosity in: The Structure of the Pivot Universe\n",
