That means there is no way to predict whether a child will be autistic or not. There is a higher chance of a child being autistic if one or both of their parents are autistic, but even then it\u2019s not certain. Autistic parents can quite easily have a neurotypical [non-autistic child] and vice versa. In fact, I\u2019m autistic and both my parents are neurotypical.\nHere\u2019s something else for you to consider though - many of the geniuses through the centuries we\u2019ve had who\u2019ve contributed to society in positive ways, either with scientific discoveries, or with savant abilities of some kind or other have also have - or are suspected to have had autism. Among these people are Sir Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Temple Grandin and Gary Numan. So, with that in mind, why would you want to prevent someone being autistic if there\u2019s also a chance they may have some special abilities? Not all autistics have savant abilities - about one in ten of them do - but not all autistic people are very disabled and unable to be independent either.", "If you're on the Autism Spectrum there's no way to guarantee that any child you have may not be born with Autism.\nIf you're definitely not on the Spectrum (confirmed by testing) the only way to ensure you're unlikely to have a child who is not autist is to only have children with someone else who is not on the Spectrum.", "You can\u2019t, since no-one knows what actually causes it.

Exercise daily for at least an hour. ...\nEat the Right Foods and Portion Each Meal. ...\nKeep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per Day. ...\nBe Sure to Get Sleep. ...\nStay Motivated.\n5 Simple Tips for Fitness Success\nCongratulations on taking a forward step to get in shape and feel great. Many people are guilty of wishing they could get a sculpted body from eating junk food and watching TV all day. But that is just not going to happen. Even though getting in shape sounds like a long, time-wasting process, the effort put towards being in shape has many positive effects. If you want to start your journey to having a better body to feel great, here are some tips:\n1. Exercise Daily\nExercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking to shed a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk pace for an hour. Or, you can jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour. Make sure you're not in severe pain during your workout. Just a warning, your muscles will ache after a high intensity workout. It may be irritating, but that means your body is changing for the better. Be sure to stay hydrated, stretch, and eat foods with a decent amount of protein after each workout. The protein will help keep your muscles, not fat, rebuilding.\n2. Eat the Right Foods and Portion Each Meal\nNo matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try to stay away from sweets. Sugar from candy will not help you get in shape. Even if it's just a single candy bar, one will eventually lead to another. Fruits and vegetables are the best thing to eat when getting into shape. Apples, for example, do a good job at making the stomach feel full for up to 3 to 4 hours. Green vegetables such as green beans and broccoli keep the digestive system clean and running.\nAlso, stick to lean meats like turkey and chicken. Seafood, such as, shrimp, and tilapia are also great alternatives. These foods are full of protein and healthy nutrients to help keep muscles fit and ready for workouts. In addition, be sure to portion what you eat. Having a good metabolism comes from portioning meals. Try to plan out eating six times a day and setting smaller portions, rather than having three large meals throughout the day. This will also help you find yourself breathing smoother when working out rather than huffing and puffing for air. This is because you will have less food in your digestive system, which means more energy is used toward your exercise.\n3. Keep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per Day\nKeeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out your physical exercising. Ever wonder why body builders' body masses are so big? That's because they plan out their meals and take in more (healthy) calories than the average person. On the other hand, losing weight and striving for a skinnier physique will involve more physical exercise than calories you ingest.\n4. Be Sure to Get Sleep\nEven though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get enough sleep to recharge the body's batteries. Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the body going throughout the day, but if you happen to feel tired at any point after coming home from work, by all means take a small nap before exercising. You should only nap for about a half hour. This will prevent you from staying up later in the night.\n5. Stay Motivated\nAn important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. If you stay positive, you will be able to push yourself to get that fit body you've always wanted.\nErie Cross Training Examiner Kyle Melerski\n, a music technology student at Capital University, is on the rise by using his creative writing skills to inform and entertain people.\nExaminer.com\nis the inside source for everything local.

It is contagious for much longer without obvious symptoms than Ebola, and is airborn. So, while it does not have the highest death rate, it is harder to stop the spread, and many, many, many more people get it, much, much faster than those other diseases, and the death of serious illness rate wasn't known-- it looked like it was higher than it was (because we couldn't see all the asymptomatic cases.) The death looked bad, and even at lower levels that arecreal, it is bad enough to want to avoid catching/spreading it.\nAnd that's where the economic cost is.

You may need to stop listening to music entirely to preserve what little is left of your hearing.\nI used to listen to the radio at what I thought was a safe, comfortable level, but then noticed a high-pitched imaginary sound as I lay in bed at night (\u201ctinnitus\u201d). When I realized that this was a sign of damage, I turned the volume control on my radio all the way down, totally, so that I couldn\u2019t hear any music, and noticed that I could STILL hear the internal hiss of the amplifier. I had been playing the sound louder than I really needed to, just to cover up that hiss. To fix it, I put an attenuator (at least 10 dB) in the line between my receiver and headphones, so I couldn\u2019t hear the hiss anymore. (Yes, this wastes 90% of the power coming out of the amplifier, but I don\u2019t care. It cleans up the hiss.)

One is a 1000:8 transformer, with the 1000-ohm side going to the receiver and the 8-ohm side to the headphones. This is actually pretty efficient, since the receiver doesn\u2019t need to pump high current through the low headphone impedance. Another is a box of pi-network resistors with bypass switches, so I can select the amount of attenuation I want. The third is an in-line stereo volume control that just splices into the line between the receiver and the headphone plug.\nOur ears, when they\u2019re working properly, can adapt to low sound levels by becoming more sensitive (just as our eyes adjust to darkness). After you put your headphones on, wait a minute or two before turning on the sound, then turn it up slowly until it\u2019s just loud enough to hear.

The more the nose runs the more difficult it will be for the virus to enter a cell.\nWhen the virus has passed the first obstacles, they may come in contact with a cell.

And has basically nothing to do this the virus. It is just a rrandom chance that the virus has adjusted to this receptor. that functions as a hook for the virus.\nThe virus is covered by an envelope of phospholipids just like the cells in the human body. So once attached the envelope and the cell mebran melt together and the RNA is unloaded to the inside of the cell.\nThe RNA is then processed by the RNA copying machine in the cell for replication.\nOnce the virus has taken over the production processes in the cell, the cell becomes sick and immune cells start the process of removing it.

T killer cells T helper cells and plasma cells etc.. These cells use H2O2 and oxygen radicals to kill pathogenes.\nIn the initial phase these cells both start the inflammatory process and limit it by releasing different types of interleukines. But at some point the inflammation gets out of hand and the inflammation just increases. This leads to inflammation substances to be released to the circulation and system collapse.\nPhysiology speaking. As the inflammation increases the cells swell up, more mucus is released. The small airways become blocked, the transport of oxygen to the circulation through the lungs becomes more and more impaired. And the patient will eventually suffocate if life support is not instituted.\nThe inflammation of the lungs also opens up for oppertunistic bacterial infections.\nThe leakage of inflammation products to the circulation leads to organ failure one after the other.\nShould the patient survive, there will be damage that will leave scars.\nThe scars are damage done by the immune system\u2019s chemicals.\nAnd there can be damage due to recruitment of prostaglandines and cytokine susbstances (inflammation signal substances) needed in the inflammation process.

Often people in different regions need different things. This may be for climatic or cultural reasons.\nWe have the resources to develop a great many different things at once.\nThe biggest example is WW2. Many countries developed many different weapons and technologies. Many attempts failed but some became highly successful. In a period of 6 years, the world saw a revolution of many different technologies.\nBritain was highly innovative during WW2 but it did lack resources to develop many ideas. One problem they had was to find a way of producing penicillin. The British shared a large number of technologies with the US. This allowed the US to develop even better technologies and in many cases doing it very rapidly and very well. Penicillin was one of the most amazing shared projects. The US had the resources needed to develop a method of producing penicillin in huge quantities. It was a revolution in medical science and save hundreds of millions of lives. The development of Penicillin also encouraged the development of many other medications. Including a large number of different antibiotics that had different advantages and different benefits. Some antibiotics were better at treating different virus types.\nOther examples in WW2 included jet engines, rockets, and radars. One group of scientists and engineers were able to develop a very small kind of radar. This radar could tell how far away an object or the ground was. They developed proximity fuses that could be used to shoot down aircraft or allow artillery shells to explode above ground which was often a very effective way of attacking targets.\nThe British had worked with Poland ad France to develop technology for breaking German codes. The US found other ways of decoding secret Japanese signals. This gave the allies a massive advantage over Germany and Japan. They could often find vital information. It played a major role in WW2 and lead to the construction of the world's first programable computers.\nBefore WW2 the US Navy had developed one modern torpedo. This was developed by one group of people. When the war started they had only one type of torpedo. After many months of combat with the Japanese, it was realized that the torpedoes were not working effectively. Many navy commanders wanted the torpedoes fixed. The group in charge of making the torpedo refused to do testing or try to improve the design of the torpedo. They repeatedly told the navy that the torpedoes worked well. Many submarine captains were blamed for not sinking Japanese ships. It Torpedo group had only tested 2 torpedos before putting them into production. One of those torpedoes failed. So in the testing, 50% of the torpedoes failed in a controlled test. In wartime conditions, the torpedoes were much worse. Eventually, the Navy forced the torpedo developers to fix the torpedoes. But thousands of lives had already been lost due to faulty torpedoes. By the end of the war a number of companies developed better torpedoes for the navy. Including a self-guiding torpedo that could sink submarines underwater. This was a clear example of one group focusing on one project and failed. Luckily this type of problem was not common. Many very capable new weapons were designed and tested and some were very successful. Though most of these projects failed the US was still able to develop war-winning technologies. WW1 was another great example of how science can achieve many revolutionary technologies at once.\nWe have the resources to develop many technologies. And we now have many scientists around the world developing different ways of defeating coronavirus. We may only need to successful projects that could save millions of lives. Out of hundreds of different projects, we may make one effective immunization and possibly a medication that will kill the virus. Doctors and scientists around the world are in a race to make the first successes. Most of them will fail. But we only need a few to succeed.", "Two words.\nGroup think.\nThis is what happens when a group of people get together for long enough. Then the group takes precedence over the thinking. Bureaucracy and politics creep in and then strangle everything and when the group becomes large enough to become the only group then that one large group\u2019s thinking becomes the only thinking left. And it becomes a thinking which can never be challenged for fear of ex-communication. People can hide in large organisations. And the wrong kind of people end up doing just that.\nThink of the largest organisations on earth. Like the United Nations. It was founded to prevent war and bring about peace. That\u2019s worked well has it not ? . The World Health Organisation was founded , inter alia , to instantaneously alert governments to the existence of contagious diseases. They did a spectacularly good job with the CCP virus. Didn't they ?. Think of the Boeing 737 Max. Think of Enron. Think of Arthur Anderson. Remember Fannie Mae ?.\nIndividuals and small groups of people solve problems. Small groups of people contributed to the development of anti retro viral ( HIV ) drugs. There were many many failures and dead ends along the way. But these failures did not bring about an end to the research.\nLarge groups of people create more problems than they solve. And the larger the group of people the bigger the problems they create. Because if there is one point of control then there is one point of failure from which there is no recovery.", "No good.\nToo many scientists nowadays are too political and promote their theories as fact either to get funding are to carry political favor!", "There are different types of science. A nuclear physicist won\u2019t have much to contribute to research on coronavirus.\nSome useful things are unexpected byproducts of different research altogether.

It doesn\u2019t see well. It gets the job done very well. How does it do it. Everyone of the members of the colony does his own job and keeps at it. The creature is the ant. This is a very successful strategy. Each ant doesn\u2019t try to do the job of another ant. Instead they do their own job.\nI know this doesn\u2019t seem intuitive but if you took all of the scientists and had them attend to one job, NOTHING would get done. Projects do not work that way. People do best when they do the same strategy as ants.\nNow as to the common cold, I would suggest if you are interested you get on that project and work hard on it. You may find out pretty quickly why that problem hasn\u2019t been solved. It isn\u2019t for lack of work. It happens to be a technical chore that is much more complicated than going to the moon.\nAlso you may not know it but the common cold as much as we hate it may in fact be the best thing that ever happened to mankind. One of its features is that it carries around genetic material borrowed from other virus and it gets your immune system exposed and strong without you catching the really nasty germs first. Yes it works somewhat like an automatic vaccination distribution lab and nobody has to run it. It may be why the COVID-19 epidemic is much less than anticipated. That\u2019s right! You may have had your life saved by a nasty cold you hated. It happens all the time.\nI would suggest you get deep into science and learn all you can but be very careful at the problems you try to solve. There may be a really good reason people have that problem and you may cause more problems by getting rid of the problem than you solve. If the cold is your hot button then study it carefully please do.

Obviously everyone is different and may experience varying effectiveness and side effects. But i\u2019ll tell you how it went for me\u2026\nFrom 14-17 y/o I had severe cystic acne. Face, neck, back - it was pretty grim. Tried all the creams and antibiotics GPs threw at me, to no avail. Eventually, I was referred to a dermatologist and prescribed isotretinoin(Roaccutane). It was pretty daunting as i\u2019d read about scary side effects and had to have blood tests to check something to do with my liver. But, the improvement in my skin was fantastic. Stopped getting new spots almost instantly and eventually old ones faded away entirely. I completed the course of I think three months which meant continuing the meds after all acne had cleared.\nTBH, it was pretty transformational for me. I started getting a social life, making friends; whereas before I'd hide in toilets, scurry off school/college site, hunker down in deserted corners of the library - anything to avoid being seen. And i was lucky in that side effects were fairly mild for me. The main ones were skin dryness (particularly my lips) and redness. Lots of moisturising, lip balm and avoiding sunlight gave some relief from that.\nI've also seen depression linked to isotretinoin a fair bit. For me, being free from severe acne eliminated the situational depressive feelings and anxiety I had. That's not to dismiss that side effect which other people may have experienced. But personally, it obliterated the source of my sadness.\nNb. One side effect to mention was that, after a night of drinking - which i shouldn't have done on those meds - i did develop a rash that similar to scraping your knee or something. But that left after a couple of days.\nHope that helps, and best of luck with whatever treatment you go for.", "What are people story\u2019s on accutane? Do you guys have any before and after pics.

You\u2019re not alone.\nJust the act of trying too hard can cause (or continue) a cycle of anxious, nerve-wracking energy that keeps our minds awake.\nAnd if your mind can\u2019t sleep, it\u2019s really difficult for your body to follow. But there are scientific tricks you can try to flip the switch and guide your body into a safe shutdown mode.\nsense.bio\ncover some science-based tricks to help you fall asleep faster.\nHow to sleep in 10 seconds\nIt usually takes a magic spell to fall asleep this quickly and on cue, but just like spells, with practice you can eventually get to the sweet 10-second spot.\nNote: The method below takes a full 120 seconds to finish, but the last 10 seconds is said to be truly all it takes to finally snooze.\nThe popular military method, which was first reported by Sharon Ackerman, comes from a book titled \u201cRelax and Win: Championship Performance.\u201d\nAccording to Ackerman, the United States Navy Pre-Flight School created a routine to help pilots fall asleep in 2 minutes or less. It took pilots about 6 weeks of practice, but it worked \u2014 even after drinking coffee and with gunfire noises in the background.\nThis practice is said to even work for people who need to sleep sitting up!\nThe military method\nRelax your entire face, including the muscles inside your mouth.\nDrop your shoulders to release the tension and let your hands drop to the side of your body.\nExhale, relaxing your chest.\nRelax your legs, thighs, and calves.\nClear your mind for 10 seconds by imagining a relaxing scene.\nIf this doesn\u2019t work, try saying the words \u201cdon\u2019t think\u201d over and over for 10 seconds.\nWithin 10 seconds, you should fall asleep!\nHow to sleep in 60 seconds\nThese two methods, which focus on your breathe or muscles, help you take your mind off topic and back to bed.\nIf you\u2019re a beginner trying these hacks out, these methods may take up to 2 minutes to work.\n4-7-8 breathing method\nMixing together the powers of meditation and visualization, this breathing method becomes more effective with practice. If you have a respiratory condition, such as asthma or COPD, consider checking with your doctor before beginning, as this could aggravate your symptoms.\nTo prepare, place the tip of your tongue against the roof of your mouth, behind your two front teeth. Keep your tongue there the whole time and purse your lips if you need to.\nHow to do one cycle of 4-7-8 breathing:\nLet your lips part slightly and make a whooshing sound as you exhale through your mouth.\nThen close your lips and inhale silently through your nose. Count to 4 in your head.\nThen hold your breath for 7 seconds.\nAfter, exhale (with a whoosh sound) for 8 seconds.\nAvoid being too alert at the end of each cycle. Try to practice it mindlessly.\nComplete this cycle for four full breaths. Let your body sleep if you feel relaxation coming on earlier than anticipated.\nHow to fall asleep in 120 seconds\nIf the previous methods still didn\u2019t work, there might be an underlying blockage you need to get out. Try these techniques!\nTell yourself to stay awake:\nAlso called paradoxical intention, telling yourself to stay awake may be a good way to fall asleep faster.\nFor people \u2014 especially those with insomnia \u2014 trying to sleep can increase performance anxiety.\nResearch has found that people who practiced paradoxical intention fell asleep faster than those who didn\u2019t. If you often find yourself stressed out about trying to sleep, this method may be more effective than traditional, intentional breathing practices.\nVisualise a calm place :\nIf counting activates your mind too much, try engaging your imagination.\nSome say that visualising something can make it real, and it\u2019s possible this works with sleep, too.\nImage distraction :\nInstead of counting sheep, try to imagine a serene setting and all the feelings that go with it. For example, you can imagine a waterfall, the sounds of echoing, rushing water, and the scent of damp moss. The key is to let this image take up space in your brain to prevent yourself from \u201cre-engaging with thoughts, worries, and concerns\u201d pre-sleep.\nSleep is the best\nmeditation"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Hello Sense", "view_list": [21, 25, 4]}, "395": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["A.

In this piece, let\u2019s talk about 5 of those changes which are turning work from homes extremely unhealthy for us and how in fact you can turn around the same situation to your advantage.\nSitting Posture\nMost of us have long sitting hours at work. Now, these days as we work from home, there\u2019s a change in the way we sit to work because of the change in where we sit. We might have much ergonomically favorable equipment at work, but most don\u2019t have the luxury of having even a good enough set of chair-table with an acceptable height range, armrest support, etc. as we work at homes. Many of us lie around on beds or loungers as we work, literally calling those chronic neck and back pains to our doors.\nTurn it around:\nWe need to be conscious about our spine being straight as we sit, our feet resting flat, our wrists resting on some support, and our neck straight looking at the computer. That\u2019s the aim. Now, we have to do what best we can do in our current situation. So, check whether your current place and position are the best you can do.\nMake use of pillows and cushions and dining tables or grandmom\u2019s chair, or just about anything to improve the situation. The best part about being at home is the availability of things and convenience to use them without getting noticed. Who knows you might be able to make use of them to turn your posture even better.\n2. Sitting and Sitting\nWe got ready in the morning, stepped out, and commuted to work. We got to move around for meetings and other work. We went to have lunch/snacks and then stroll as we took breaks. But, as we work from homes, there are no such opportunities to move around. We are spending most of our time on the couches or beds, not just overweighting a few more kgs which look bad but more importantly ramping up the development of all possible lifestyle conditions in our bodies to be surfaced sooner.\nTurn it around:\nWe need to sneak in opportunities to move around. One good way is to share a little more load of household chores from your wives or parents. It will not just help you become more active, but also help your relations get stronger.\nAnother great way is to stand and walk as we do our meetings and conversations, ideate, or take a break. It can become an important contributor to your activity every day. In fact, you might have to just sit around for most of the meetings at work, which you could now use to walk and talk. That could mean even more activity throughout the day than what you used to do at work.\n3. Delayed or Skipped Meals\nBreakfast needs to be within 1\u20132 hours of waking up and then the further meals of the day must be spaced out every 2\u20133 hours. That is a health fact.\nNow, if we are waking up late since we don\u2019t have to get ready and reach offices, or staying on our calls and finishing our deadlines, or are not feeling like pausing that Netflix episode in between, we might be missing our meal timings. What could be worse is missing them altogether due to our laziness to cook or serve.\nTurn it around:\nLook at it this way. You are home, you do not have to pack and take anything in the boxes. Whatever you want, whenever you want, you can just pick up or cook and have. You can take advantage of this opportunity and make sure that you can correct all your meal timings to fit in well in your schedule. In fact, this period could be a great time for you to build this habit which would become easier to sustain once you join back as you would have got used to it the easier way meanwhile. All you have to do is set the right routine.\nIf you feel cooking is a hassle, do it when you can squeeze out time and make a little extra for when you cannot find the time. You could learn more simple dishes which are available all over the internet.\n4. Munching & Snacking\nWe often associate weekends with eating special foods and binge-watching and munching. Now that we are all locked up at homes, somehow we end up eating those namkeens, and chips, and biscuits, and Maggie more often.\nTurn it around:\nNow that we are home and we cannot order outside food, we can try many more options about which we might not even think about while at work. You could try snacking on fruits and fresh salads, sprouts, fresh juices, poha, sandwiches, yogurt bowls, or simple peanuts. There are plenty of healthy options to explore at home. This might be your chance to get used to healthier snack meals.\n5. Random Sleeping hours\nWhether it is because of the never-ending work and calls, or those unfinished movies and serials, or an intense game session, we might be shifting our bedtimes late. There\u2019s also this subconscious thought of not going to the office tomorrow morning. And the consequence would be on the time and condition we wake up the next day. Since the routine has gotten disturbed, many of us have not been following our bedtimes and wake up times properly leading to unfinished or oversleep impacting our days clearly as well as our bodies internally.\nTurn it around:\nSince we are saving time on the commute and other nonproductive things, this might be a chance for us to use that time better, while maintaining our 7\u20138 hours of a healthy sleep cycle.

It's then wrapped on plastic and put onto the fridge for 30 minutes, to allow the dough to relax and the butter to firm.\nAfter 30 minutes, it's removed from the fridge, rolled into a rectangle, and the two ends are rolled across the middle. Then, it's back to the fridge to cooln and gmhsrden the butter. Again.\nThis process is treated and treated until enough layers of butter have been formed if memory serves, it end up with more than 1000 layers of butter\nAre that point, it's cut and shaped until so many things, including the crescent shape that's commonly called a \u201ccroissant\", named for the crest on the Moorish flag baked by the Viennese bakers who initially made this lovely French pastry in order to celebrate the fact that their army had defeated the Moorish advance into Vienna.", "No. Brioche contains a high amount of carbs and fat, and is not any healthier than white bread."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Daniel Guerra", "view_list": [7, 209, 96, 5]}, "441": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What if all the people of Earth snore at the same time?", "topic_list": ["Snoring", "Hypothetical Planetary Science Scenarios", "Sleep Science", "Sleep Habits", "Earth (planet)", "Planetary Science", "Sleep", "Astronomy", "Hypothetical Scenarios", "Health"], "no_of_view": "120", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Saikat Das", "view_list": []}, "825": {"no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Thyaga Rajan", "Niloy Basu"], "question_title": "Why do people think the coronavirus will go away in April?", "topic_list": ["April (month)", "Health Advice", "Dermatology", "COVID-19 (2019-2020)", "Medical Conditions and Diseases", "Understanding Human Behavior", "Psychology of Everyday Life", "Health", "Human Behavior", "Life Advice", "Medicine and Healthcare"], "no_of_view": "672", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "ans_list": ["Unlike the cong leaders* these people** are optimistic and think of nation\u2019s progress and its good, though not many may be able to contribute at gross level.\n*If you cannot lead, not mislead, if you cannot be of any help, never be a hurdle. **Faith moves mountains.", "It will slow down after 26 July and it will go away after 23 September.

I doubt Biden will be able to function as POTUS for 4 years without serious issues manifesting\u2026", "Hello!\nPresident High Priest of Diarrhea Gargling is a typical patient suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). And a total waste of time. When the NPD enters therapy he or she does so, not with the intent of becoming a better person, but as a game, with the goal of beating the therapist and \u201cproving they [the narcissist] are the smartest person in the room.\u201d For the narcissist, therapy isn\u2019t a journey, it\u2019s a zero sum game in which they must always be the winner.\nNPD may be how psychology defines evil. A principal feature of the NPD is that they do not consider themselves to have a mental health problem. In other words, they\u2019re not the problem, you are. The NPD finds a way to blame others for their problems. A natural consequence of this point of view is a phenomenon known as \u201cgaslighting.\u201d Wikipedia defines gaslighting this way:\nGaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation in which a person or a group covertly sows seeds of doubt in a targeted individual, making them question their own memory, perception, or judgment, often evoking in them cognitive dissonance and other changes such as low self-esteem.\nSince about 1% of the population is NPD, chances are fairly good that you have met one. If you\u2019ve been particularly unlucky, as some have been, then an NPD has exercised significant influence over your life. In that way the people of the United States of America have been particularly unlucky these days. The president is a narcissist, and We the People are subjected to daily gaslighting, compliments of Donald Trump.\nIf only the press in particular and We the People in general had known NPDs the way my therapist friend does, we might have saved ourselves a lot of trouble. For one, Trump would have never been elected in the first place. The voters would have \u201creferred him out.\u201d For another, the members of the press might have skipped the part back in 2017 where they were racing each other to report the moment in time in which Donald Trump had \u201cfinally become presidential.\u201d That day was never going to happen. Narcissists don\u2019t get better.\nA recent example of narcissistic gaslighting from Trump came after he recommended injecting disinfectant as a possible \u201ccure\u201d for coronavirus. Trump gaslighted the American people the very next day by insisting he was addressing a reporter \u201csarcastically,\u201d that he didn\u2019t mean it literally. This despite the fact that we have video proof of Trump directly addressing the question to Dr. Deborah Birx in a distinctly non-sarcastic way. The implication is that anyone who didn\u2019t \u201cget it,\u201d that Trump was being sarcastic, that he didn\u2019t mean it literally, must be stupid. That is how the narcissist gaslights.\nA mistake often made by victims of the narcissist is they believe that they can bring the narcissist to see reason. This creates in the victim a tendency to concede minor points in order to make a major one. It might come in the form of the victim saying, for example, \u201cOkay, I concede you were not trying to be deliberately cruel by your remarks, but can you understand how you might have been accidentally cruel?\u201d These concessions, made a little bit at a time, are seized upon by the narcissist and used against the victim as weapons. The narcissist may later say something like, \u201cWhat do you mean by that? You said it yourself once, that I\u2019m not cruel. Were you lying?\u201d Trump frequently uses small concessions or retractions or admissions of error made by the press as weapons against them.\nNarcissists never admit they are wrong and Trump is no exception. What\u2019s more, Trump has trained people who work for him to become extremely reluctant to admit when Trump has made a mistake. Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has fallen reluctant but inevitable victim to Trump\u2019s bullying in this way.\nTrump\u2019s daily press conferences are explicit exercises in narcissism, gaslighting and cruelty. Trump never does anything that he doesn\u2019t want to do and these daily \u201cbriefings\u201d are a case in point. They are extremely dangerous and it is to the shame of the American press that they are still being broadcast.\nSeveral people have died as a direct consequence of these briefings. For example, an Arizona couple recently drank chloroquine phosphate, a fish tank cleaner, because Trump recommended hydroxychloroquine as a \u201ccure\u201d for coronavirus.

At this interview, the vaccine question woulld often come up. Sometimes anti-vaxxers would ask if we were flexible (no except in very unusual circumstances as I will enumerate below) and even more often, from parents who wanted to feel safe that we didn\u2019t allow anti-vaxxers.\nWith the alarming increase in the numbers of autistic children in the last 10\u201320 years (yes I believe that it was happening and not just in increase in the diagnosis), there were families whose first child was autistic and then they would be skittish about having subsequent children immunized, even though we had successfully convinced them that there was no connection. (Unfortunately many parents thought that their children \u201cbecame autistic\u201d after the 12-month MMR vaccine. That is when parents would notice that their one-year-old was not acquiring language normally, even though we had observed warning signs much earlier in their baby\u2019s development.)\nI know that I have written about this particular case before, but it stands out as an example of one which our policy of being slightly flexible backfired on the family and on our practice. It was one in which the first child, a boy, was clearly autistic even at the 6-month visit. We didn\u2019t label him autistic that early because there were no early interventions at that time compared to now. At a year, he was not progressing developmentally and the mother was pregnant with her second child. We convinced them to allow the baby to receive his MMR vaccine. As her second pregnancy continued, her exposure to the anti-vaccine movement was increasing, so the parents asked us if we could modify the vaccine schedule.\nIn their minds, that meant would we allow them to postpone the vaccines until after 1 year. Many parents thought that it would be a safer time to administer the vaccines. They believed that in the first few months, the baby\u2019s immune system was too fragile to process \u201cso many\u201d vaccines starting at two months. Our position was just the opposite: Since babies are unprotected at that point, that is exactly why the vaccine schedule starts at two months.\nThe one concession that we did allow was to separate the vaccines into several visits so that they were not receiving more than one or two shots. There was no data to suggest that this would be \u201csafer,\u201d and in reality, many of the vaccines were already combinations. This flexibility made parents a little more comfortable, and we were still keeping the child on track with the required vaccines.\nThis family had other plans however. They postponed all well-baby visits starting at two months saying that the baby had a cold. Same at four months.\nAt five months, they scheduled a sick visit for the baby because she had a fever and a cough. They sat in the waiting room (sick area) for at least ten minutes when my receptionist noticed that the baby\u2019s cough sounded \u201cweird.\u201d It turned out to be pertussis (the P of the DaPT) which she hadn\u2019t yet received. She required hospitalization and was seriously sick with the whooping cough.\nFollowing the hospitalization, we had to make the difficult decision of discharging this family because they had not complied with our policies.

On many people that can be on the other side of course.\nFor many years I was put on hydrocodone and took six of those a day. They rarely helped at all and I guess that is the reason I never became addicted to them. After about five years and many thousands of pills, I decided that the danger of taking those what's not worth the tiny bit of help they provided. After receiving a bottle of 180 of the hydrocodone pills, I said enough and mailed them using a special envelop provided for getting rid of unwanted medication. No, I am not crazy (but my memory is going bye-bye) and realize that I could have sold them or given them away. You have to understand that I am not interested in money beyond what I need to live comfortably. On top of that I had lost my mother and my oldest sister to abuse of hydrocodone.\nI then went back to taking great numbers of aspirin. As a otherwise healthy 81 year old man I have never had trouble with aspirin causing stomach problems. Since then I have learned two things which really aggravate my sciatica.\nThe first is that I have always carried a very thick wallet in my jeans on my right side and was asked by my personal position, on the way out of his office, what I had in my right back pocket. You get the point, I stopped wearing my wallet in the back and removed about half of the junk that I carried in the wallet that I did not need. That alone gave me more relief than the hydrocodone ever did.\nThe second thing that brought me the most relief and has made my back pain tolerable. What I am going to tell you cost nothing and over a few weeks it was like a miracle.\nI learned from somewhere and I think it may have even been a bumper sticker that read, \u201cAre you sitting on your tailbone?\u201d. I was, but no longer. I realized that I had been sitting in my chair at the computer where I had a small business and had to sit there for hours every day.\nI started looking down at how I was sitting as my back would ache and then very quickly realized that all I had to do was to sit up straighter and to push my butt deep into the office chair. I had spent my life sitting on my tailbone. And even when I sat on a couch watching TV or at the table during my meals that I naturally would slump and simply had to learn to listen to my body telling me to get off my tailbone. And I realized that even when I was sitting in my ergonomically designed car seat that I was not pushing my butt back into it.\nPlease recognize that none of this is good science and it's just an anecdotal story but I thought that it may help somebody and that it cost nothing for a person to try. Give it a chance and don't expect instant relief from all the pain.

Its \u201cForm Follows Function\", which means that the way we use our body will cause it to develop in certain ways. In your case, your body is developing trigger points.\nYour trigger points are a result of chronic amounts of excessive mechanical stress in key areas of your muscles. Youre also not giving your muscles enough opportunity to recover. Recovery simply involves reducing the amount of tension in your muscles.\nBecause you're developing trigger points, it means that your muscles are constantly working and generating metabolic waste, even when you're not doing anything. There's elevated tension in the muscle and its like that all the time.\nSo the solution isnt to focus on your trigger points, but rather, on the way that youre using your body during a particular activity.\nThis involves something known as movement education. The best known and most effective form of movement education is The Feldenkrais Method. This is probably the main solution to your problem.\nOther precipitating factors can include viscero-somatic reflexes from metabolic issues, namely from dietary caused inflammation.\nThe last and equally important factor is emotional stress causing increased muscle tension.

Strictly limit more complex carbs such as beans and whole grains to under 100 grams/per day.\nSuch a low carbohydrate diet may cause a loss of excess body weight.

A country with less investment in medicine overall will be more likely to have poor methods of keeping track of how many cases of what kinds are actually being dealt with out in the country and how. They can\u2019t afford the test kits so they don\u2019t buy many or deploy them and so never get to know how many people actually have Covid-19 out there, and how many may be dying wityhout coming into contact with their less than ideal health service.\nIgnorance can be bliss. They have few cases being reported and might be tempted to say \u2018we don\u2019t have a problem then\u2019, when actually they do.\nAnd in countries that do technically have the infrastructure there are nause ups. Here in the UK the official counts stupidly excluded deaths in care homes for the elderly until the last couple of days, our health dpeartment bought a load of cheap test kits that turned to be so cheap they were useless and our use of population testing has been so hit and miss at the moment we can\u2019t tell whether 5% or the population have had the virus or 50%", "It\u2019s the age-old lesson that just because you got all the right stuff, doesn\u2019t mean the leadership will make much use out of it. As the saying goes, an army of five lions will defeat an army of five thousand sheep.\nProper leaders make the necessary precautions and preparations. This is why a small country like Taiwan is holding very well against the coronavirus outbreak, whereas a much larger country like mainland China with its massive medical infrastructure failed to even consider containment once detected. Leadership counts much more than manpower and technology, because it\u2019s leadership that decide the latter\u2019s application.\nSo what if I am sitting on top of a bazillion N95 face masks and a metric tonne of toilet paper? It makes no difference if I light a match and set it all on fire because someone on Facebook dared me to. Good leaders always produce good countries, no matter their size or form.", "Because per a study done in Seattle, pollution has a lot to do with the spread of this virus. Specifically, Round-up (glyphosate and polyethoxylated tallow amine) as well as the hydrocarbons of the exhaust fumes.", "It depends on what metric you use to measure, and there are many exceptions. So many exceptions that I doubt if it is true\nIf you use the metric of how many deaths, then of course bigger more populous countries have more deaths.\nEven if you correct to number of deaths per 100,000 population, well there are many things that can skew the numbers. For example, what do you count as a death? If you restrict it to only deaths (easy and cheap to diagnose) that were diagnosed via testing for covid 19 (not so easy and cheap to diagnose) then you have the answer. A poor country already has poor medical infrastructure and has many many deaths from normal pneumonia so a few more will not be noticed. And if the medical infra is bad then they have very limited capability to test for covid-19. As such most deaths will be unconfirmed and will not be included in the list\nThe USA is a special case. Rich enough to do lots of covid 19 tests so a lot of the covid 19 deaths are documented as proven and added to the list, i.e. a large percentage of cases are detected. PLUS factors which actually make the numbers of diseased higher. Such as suboptimal leadership, low scientific literacy, cultural resistance to masks and quarantine and losing money, etc. A double blow.\nAbility to afford to test lots of people for covid 19 = more confirmed cases/confirmed deaths is the most plausible scenario, specially for places like south east asia where singapore has a huge number of cases even if the population is small\nPH tops ASEAN countries with most number of COVID-19 cases; possible underreported recoveries: data experts\nIn other places where the medical infra is equally good, then you can easily see which other factors explain the differences in rates among countries\nFrom a scientific perspective, and in the absence of better models\n, the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland \u2013 which are culturally, economically, politically and geographically similar \u2013 may, serendipitously, represent a powerful intervention trial.\n\u2026\nThe Swedish approach to COVID-19 could not be more different from its neighbours, placing much of the responsibility for delaying the spread of the virus and protecting the vulnerable in the hands of the public\n. It\u2019s now April and, albeit with some restrictions, Swedish bars, restaurants and schools remain open.\n\u2026\nAs of March 28, the reproduction numbers for Sweden and Norway are estimated to be 2.47 and 0.97 respectively, with Denmark\u2019s around one. Unsurprisingly, the spread of the virus is also estimated to be among the highest in Sweden (3.1% of the population infected) and lowest in Norway (0.41% of the population), likely reflecting the radically different containment strategies.\n\u2026\nThose simulations show that the overall burden is expected to be similar\nacross countries, resulting in about 528 to 544 deaths per million. Importantly though, unlike its peers, Sweden is likely to take the hit sooner and over a shorter period, with the majority of deaths occurring within weeks, rather than months.\nCoronavirus: why the Nordics are our best bet for comparing strategies\nBut it remains to be seen if Sweden will be worse off in the long run\nConsider too that the effects of intensive restrictions on freedom of movement wanes over time as social disobedience increases. Deploying milder containment strategies, as Sweden has done, which are followed by nearly all, may be more effective than strict interventions that are frequently flouted. Here, it will be interesting to see how Sweden compares to the other Nordic countries, which may have been able to achieve high levels of compliance with voluntary social distancing.\nThere\u2019s also the perpetual danger of epidemic resurgence where herd immunity \u2013 whereby enough people have been infected to prevent the virus from spreading further \u2013 has not been achieved. Sweden is likely to reach herd immunity faster, so it\u2019s not impossible that it will see fewer additional outbreaks of the virus than its neighbours. And there are numerous economic arguments too\n.\nThere is no knowing at this stage how the interventions adopted by Sweden and the other Nordic nations will play out. But within weeks, this will start to become clear. From this, we will learn much about the delicate balance between strategic under- and overreaction in the face of an infectious disease pandemic.\nAnd what we learn may serve other nations where COVID-19 is still emerging or where second and third waves hit, as well as future societies facing other global pandemics, which are certain to come.\nsame article as above", "Good Question!\nThe reason is because of some very simple realities. The nations with the top medical technology have populations which are used to being able to take a shot or pop a pill and \u201cPoof\u201d magically their medical problem is gone. The result is their people don\u2019t believe that they need to be cautious and careful of things like Hygiene. This makes them sitting ducks when a disease comes along that there are no pills and no vaccines for. The only real defenses are hygiene measures. Nothing else really works. Other nations have never been able to get away from the basic facts.\nActually these technically top of the line nations have the least competence to deal with the situation because they don\u2019t even believe they need to do the things necessary to survive.\nI will cover this a bit more: The social justice warriors have run around tearing down the social constraints claiming they were bigotry. They were not! They were the basic defenses against disease. Yes the whole lot of social constraints the leftists have been tearing down were and still are life saving measures. YOU JUST DIDN\u2019T KNOW! I will drop you a hint. The immigration issues were this. Ellis Island was built over these issues.\nThat facility on the left is a HOSPITAL!

I\u2019m not big on supplements, though, so here are some easy ways to make sure you\u2019re getting your omegas in\u2026\nWalnuts. Pumpkin Seeds. Canola Oil. Seaweed. Chia Seeds. Flaxseed or flaxseed oil.\nSoy based foods like edamame, tofu, tempeh, miso, soy milk, soybean oil.\nA proper whole grain wheat or health nut bread often has plenty of pumpkin seeds, flaxseeds, chia seeds or walnuts in it.\nChia seeds are an easy one. All you need is 1-2 tablespoons per day and they are basically tasteless. You can sprinkle it in your salad dressing, soups, pasta sauces, shakes\u2026 whatever\u2026 and you\u2019ll never notice the difference (except maybe visually.) You can do pretty much the same with flaxseed oil.\nHere are a couple omega links Plant Sources of Omega-3s\n& Essential Fatty Acids\nOther than that I can\u2019t say what you may be missing, nutrient wise, without knowing what foods you do eat. A quick scan through this article The Role of Vitamins and Minerals in Hair Loss: A Review\non hair loss (again from the NCBI) tells me that an iron or zinc deficiency may contribute to thinning hair\u2026 as may consuming too much vitamin A. You might consider those in your diet. Don\u2019t assume you get plenty of iron just from meat\u2026 the vast majority of women who suffer from iron deficiency are meat eaters.\nAgain, I\u2019m not a nutritionist but I hope this and the links I provided can be of some help.\n8 )", "Have you tried Lecithin?A soybean extract that I rarely see in health food stores anymore.Still,it would be beneficial to your overall health.Hope this helps.\nMaybe you could add 50 mg.of selenium,and zinc tablets to bolster the immune system.Also try to locate a source for purchasing Yucca.You need fibre as supplied by whole grain and walnuts.Find power sources of vitamin D,for that is taken for healthy hair."], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Elizabeth Lamas", "view_list": [1, 5, 71, 4, 55, 39]}, "374": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 4, "name_list": ["Alan Vint", "Cara Crawford", "C.

First, if you wake up on your own, gently sliding from very light sleep to \u201cawakeness\u201d due to some pleasant sensory stimulant (sight, sound, scent or touch - taste first thing in the morning isn\u2019t likely pleasant), it is very much a different experience emotionally than being jolted awake from deeper sleep by that annoying alarm sound you vouched to change weeks ago. The parameters used by Oura to define your overall \u201cchargedness\u201d, the Contributors, might show sub-optimal results compared to your baseline, but when waking up happy you don\u2019t yet know that you\u2019ll run out of energy by lunch time. Second, do you have something in your upcoming day that gets you pumped up (and gets that good ol\u2019 adrenaline running) like the first ever marathon after 12 months of training, or something that you are really looking for like meeting your future father-in-law for the first time (making you feel really really good emotionally)? To sum up the possible reasons for your experience I came up with on the spot: you\u2019ll feel better than data warrants of you wake up naturally, or if you are in a good place emotionally, or if something gets you a nice adrenaline rush.\nA human being is an immensely fascinating entity and there are so many angles into every story of what we feel and how we do that it never seizes to amaze me. Conflicts of data vs. feeling like you describe in your question are great moments to possibly learn something valuable of oneself going forward. I am very proud of being a long-term Ouranian, it is just a ring but it gives you so much to think about, to learn of yourself and how your body reacts to, well, anything and everything!\nThen again, the conflict you mentioned could very well be a hardware, software or data interpretation error, as the Oura ring is by no means perfect in its measurements and accuracy - just like any such device.

The first set is called controllable circumstances - these are the things that you can control. These are the things that I will be talking about. The second set of circumstances are those that are present but you have no control over them. These are things like your blood group, your age, and pre-existing conditions. So, I will not be talking about them.\nGetting infected, you may say that you have no control over it. My view is that if we take maximal precautions from getting the disease then we have done our best. All infections are not created equal. Yes, I am aware that people think that either you are infected or you are not infected. Now, let us look at a real-life scenario. Scenario one: You and your friend are sitting across from one another and having a beer. Your friend across the table has a strong sneeze and he sprays you with his droplets. You end up inhaling them right into your lungs. Since the virus has just got out of his system they are likely to be virulent. Scenario two: You enter the toilet where your friend had coughed about ten minutes ago. The droplets are still floating in the air. Some of them enter your mouth, nose, and trachea. These particles floating about in the air will almost be restructured (viruses do not die because they are NOT living things when outside the host (living human being or bat)\nIn scenario two, if you get infected, it will take longer for the symptoms to show up and there is a possibility that you may not get infected. For these reasons, I said that all infections are not created equal. I am sure you have read about people who have the disease but not the symptoms. These people probably fall into this group.\nNow, let me talk about the things you can do to reduce the chances of succumbing to the disease - COVID-19. Eat right always. This is important as it will keep your immunity level high. With good immunity, your body may be able to ward off a weak infection, the type described in scenario two. There are other things you can do to keep your immunity at its optimal. These include drinking lots of water (not beer or alcohol - they lower your immunity. A moderate amount of exercise. Too much exercise weakens you. So refrain from overindulging. Deep breathing and being well hydrated will ensure that if you are exposed to a weak infection you may be able to prevent it. So not smoke. Smoking lowers immune resistance.\nIf you usually take nutritional supplements continue to do so. If you do not take these regularly then do not start. Obesity and hypertension are known as aggravating factors. Work on these but not to go the extreme of fasting. Take your BP medications as prescribed. If you are an Asthmatic or have any other breathing condition make sure you take your medications and do not develop symptoms of \u201ctight chest\u201d or \u201cshortness of breath.\u201d If you have allergies take your antiallergic medications as prescribed.\nThese are my words of wisdom.

Did they take too much of it?\nMedical professionals have not been looking at hydroxychloroquine as a vaccine. There are a few doctors that have tried a combination of hydroxychloroquine ( not hydrochloroquine) and azithromycin as a treatment for the severe symptoms of Covid-19. A large scale controlled trial in Brazil of this proposed treatment was cut short because of heart problems in the treatment group, but not the placebo group. That is an indication it is not safe. The President was premature in his questions about the use of this drug. He did not have all the information about it, but no one else did, either. The trial was due to other doctors\u2019 case reports, not the President\u2019s questions about its use. The protocol used in the trial was the same protocol used in the case reports and was not an overdose. Another trial at an Army base in the US had the same result. These trials have mostly put an end to the medical community\u2019s efforts to use hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19.", "\u201c\u2026If the medical professionals are looking at hydrcloriquine a vaccine for this virus, \u201c\nNo. It is a treatment. Words have meaning, please use the right ones whenever possible.\n\u201c\u2026why did people get sick when they took it \u201c\nSometimes you have to evaluate the benefits against the side effects. Chemotherapy makes you very sick but it helps to eliminate the cancer. Sick is better than dead so you put up with the sick of Chemo so you can get past it and then be not sick and cancer free. Sick for a while is the side effect, alive is the benefit.\nSick from hydrcloriquine for a few days is better than dead forever.", "OK. First, there\u2019s a difference between a vaccine and a treatment.\nA vaccine prevents many/most people from getting a disease by helping their body build antibodies that make them \u201cimmune.\u201d Vaccines only work before you get symptoms.\nA treatment helps your body fight the infection that you are experiencing after you get symptoms.\nThere is no vaccine for this virus, but obviously many people are working on that. There will not be a vaccine available for this virus until 2021 or later.\nHydroxychloroquine is a drug that was speculated about as a treatment, for people who were already sick with the virus. It is being tested in several large-scale and global clinical trials for that, and also for possibly being able to reduce the risk of initial infection in health care workers. We don\u2019t have strong information back one way or another about whether it works at all. It does have side effects, and those side effects have killed people in some cases. They even led to the cancelation of one study.\nThere was one elderly couple in the U.S. who ate fish tank cleaner (a poison) because it contained chloroquine. Since what they ate was in fact a cleaning compound and not a medication, they got very sick from the poison and one of them died.\nAll other cleaning compounds that kill the virus on surfaces in your kitchen, or on your hands, are poisons when put within the human body. You cannot drink them. You cannot eat them. You cannot inject them. If you do you will die, no matter what the U.S. President may suggest.\nThere are, however, a number of other compounds that are being tested as possible treatments for COVID-19. Those tests are ongoing, and it could be that in the next few months we find one or more drugs that can be at least somewhat helpful to some patients with the disease.", "If the medical professionals are looking at hydrcloriquine a vaccine for this virus, why did people get sick when they took it (at trump's suggestion)? Did they take too much of it?\nIt was NEVER looked at as a vaccine\nSome people suggested it as a treatment, and some experiments were done. Early claims were made that it is an effective cure.\nWhen actual tests were conducted, however, it turned out that the death rate was higher among patients who were treated with chloroquine. This is largely due to the known fact that chloroquine can cause an irregular heatbeat and intermittent heart stoppage. People weakened by the virus did not survive when their heart stopped.\nThe clinical trials in process were quickly terminated when the first results were reported, since the side effects were well known, and the only question was whether the positive impact outweighed the risk. But the clinical trials also showed no positive effect at all in terms of killing the virus\u2026.only the anticipated heart stoppages.", "Bleach is hypochloric acid.\nHydrochloric acid would be still worse.\nHypochloric acid is corrosive to skin and mucous membranes and can cause severe chemical burns, or blindness if contacted with the eyes.\nConsuming it by drinking can cause the throat to swell, blocking off the air supply."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Joyce Hall", "view_list": [130, 149, 84, 117, 116, 78]}, "149": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Bikram Chand Rai"], "question_title": "How long does it take the yellow from jaundice to go away?", "topic_list": ["Jaundice", "Health", "Medicine and Healthcare"], "no_of_view": "594", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["this s liver problem Fatty liver and other liver problems.might take up to 6 months.Take liver care,liver supplements etc from any pharmacy\nDrink plenty water,drink herbal teas,eat more fresh fruits aand veg/ etc"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Roksana Parvin Yasmin", "view_list": [28]}, "175": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 4, "name_list": ["Justin Brader", "Quora User", "Richard Browne", "Tracy Crissman"], "question_title": "What causes more pain or knockout power, a knee to the face or an elbow?", "topic_list": ["Elbow Pain and Injuries", "Knee Pain", "Elbows", "Pain Management", "Knees", "Faces", "Orthopedics", "Pain (sensation)", "Health", "Medicine and Healthcare"], "no_of_view": "837", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["A knee to the elbow wouldn't cause much knockout at all so I'm gonna say a knee to the face.", "The knee cap and elbow pain is footballer person and old person is pain occur in people that eat red meat", "A knee, if you actually have that choice.

Ischemic heart disease, or coronary artery disease\nCoronary artery disease (CAD), also known as coronary heart disease (CHD) or ischemic heart disease (IHD), involves the reduction of blood flow to the heart muscle due to build-up of plaque in the arteries of the heart. It is the most common of the cardiovascular diseases.\n2. Stroke\nA stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both result in parts of the brain not functioning properly.\n3. Lower respiratory infections\nLower respiratory tract infections are any infections in the lungs or below the voice box. These include pneumonia, bronchitis, and tuberculosis. A lower respiratory tract infection can affect the airways, such as with bronchitis, or the air sacs at the end of the airways, as in the case of pneumonia.\n4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long-term breathing problems and poor airflow. The main symptoms include shortness of breath and cough with sputum production. COPD is a progressive disease, meaning it typically worsens over time.\n5. Trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers\nIt usually originates from the right lateral wall of the trachea at the level < 2 cm above the tracheal bifurcation. The patients usually are asymptomatic, but some may experience recurrent pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, or bronchiectasis. It is very rare for a malignant tumor to grow from this aberrant bronchus.\n6. Diabetes mellitus\nDiabetes mellitus is a disorder in which blood sugar (glucose) levels are abnormally high because the body does not produce enough insulin to meet its needs. Urination and thirst are increased, and people may lose weight even if they are not trying to.\n7. Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias\nAlzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of dementia cases.\n8. Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases\nA prolonged bout of diarrhea or vomiting can cause the body to lose more fluid than it can take in. The result is dehydration, which occurs when your body doesn't have the fluid it needs to function properly. Severe dehydration can cause your kidneys to shut down\n9. Tuberculosis\nTuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but they can also damage other parts of the body. TB spreads through the air when a person with TB of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, or talks\n10. Cirrhosis\nCirrhosis, also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis, is a condition in which the liver does not function properly due to long-term damage.

A sample of the virus needs to be identified in the body and it should not prove to be dangerous either, and it has to be seen that it has no side effects. It takes a lot of time to see all this.\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of united states America is the most famous institute there.\nOn 3 March 2019, the Director of this Institute, American Senator, said that he would take at least 1.5 years to get the vaccine ready. This time may take you equivalent to doom. But just believe that these are very tight times.\nProfessor John Andres of global virology and vaccine policy told Wired that most vaccines take 5 to 15 years to come to market.\nWhy does it take so much time? This is behind the vaccine development in Stages. I will tell you the stages of vaccine development and the time taken for them.\nStages Of Vaccine Development\n(1) Discovery: \u2013\nThis means to create a weak or dead virus in the lab. It takes years in the first stage. But now due to advanced technology, it becomes a few weeks. In some places, in the case of the coronavirus outbreak, it was prepared in January.\n(2) Clinical trials: \u2013\nAfter this, the most important and time-consuming stage clinical trials means the vaccine is tested on humans. For which volunteers have to search, keeping in mind the virus confirmed cases are in clinical trials. In each phase, I will consider the type of volunteers, their number, and the time it takes.\nPhase 1:\nThe vaccine is first tested on dozens of people and this number of people should be healthy. It takes about 3 months. If there is no problem in them or there is no side effect, then they move towards the next phase.\nPhase 2:\nThis time a hundred people are vaccinated. The cells are from the area infected with the spread of the virus. This may take 6-8 months. If all goes well here, then move to the next phase.\nPhase 3:\nThousands of people are taken for this phase and that too from the area with virus outbreak. In this case, the area will be Wuhan china or its adjoining cities. If there is no problem in this phase too, then the matter moves forward. It is said that this data of all the tests go to any drug regulatory body.\nThe Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in India is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the US. These organizations look at all the data and then decide whether to approve the vaccine or not. This process can take anywhere between a month or a year.\nWHO is the world health organization. After all, this is done, the manufacturing and distribution of this vaccine started. If you are calculating, then you will know that these are being told for a year and a half, but not less. To speed up this process will mean taking a risk.

I belong to Kaiser, a mega HMO. The good thing about Kaiser is that they post doctor\u2019s profiles when you\u2019re selecting a new primary care physician. It doesn\u2019t tell you much honestly, but it gives you an idea. Since switching over to Kaiser about 11 years ago, I\u2019ve had no less than four primary care physicians. Not because I chose to switch, but because they either left or moved to a different facility that I wasn\u2019t willing to travel to.\nThe most important factor is is that the doctor must be accepting new patients. If she\u2019s not, there\u2019s no point In selecting her. There are always a few to choose from. I might have to travel five or 10 miles, but I can find one. The second most important factor for me is office hours. I don\u2019t want a doctor who is there part time if I can help it. My time is important too. When I\u2019m looking at their profiles on Kaiser, I look at how long they have been at the specific clinic I\u2019m interested in. I don\u2019t want to have to switch again. Not if I don\u2019t need to. I don\u2019t care if the doctor graduated from a fancy named medical school. That really doesn\u2019t say much about clinical ability. That\u2019s bragging rights between medical doctors.\nThe rest of the things are intangibles that I probably won\u2019t know until I meet the doctor. Male or female for me is of no importance. I\u2019ve never met a physician who couldn\u2019t speak English fluently. I don\u2019t give a damn about whether he has an accent. What I do care about is if the doctor is a good listener. Will she write a referral when necessary? If she is egocentric, self-important, I don\u2019t have time for that.Until you meet a doctor in the office, there\u2019s no way to know.\nYears ago I stopped seeing a primary care physician who was full of himself. He wasn\u2019t any better or any worse than any other physician as a clinician, but he was dismissive, rude, and his office staff was worse. After my husband suffered a medical emergency because of his office staff\u2019s negligence, we immediately switched physicians. Incidentally he closed his practice a year after that. I suspect I wasn\u2019t the only one who found him to be a less than ideal doctor. We received a letter that he was going into his life\u2019s calling, computer science. OK. It happens. My last PCP was a young Muslim man. He was young enough to be my son. I\u2019m not 60 yet - I liked him because he was a good listener. The last time I was forced to switch, I chose my husband\u2019s primary care physician. He\u2019s been there for years, he is well liked, and although he\u2019s nearing retirement age, chances are he\u2019s not going to leave for other reasons. It\u2019s been six months, and I can\u2019t make a regular appointment because of COVID-19.\nMost of the time people switch doctors when they\u2019re ill, they don\u2019t have one, and just need the first one who comes along. It is not bragging rights to have a new patient call and make an appointment. A doctor\u2019s qualifications aren\u2019t something that most people can judge. it\u2019d availability that matters. All doctors you that they are best. Are they? They are the best of treating some patients, but not all. People choose doctors like themselves because they\u2019re looking for someone who would be empathetic to their cultural sensibilities. it matters in health care. It\u2019s just not high at all on my list.", "The last two PCPs I\u2019ve picked had the unique qualification of simply taking patients. One guy I picked in 2015, when I moved to the area, was great and I liked him, but retired in a year or so. The second was good, but not the most comprehensive physician I\u2019ve met, mainly since he was also an administrator for his group. He is technically competent, and I have learned I have to advocate for myself. I think the issue is he\u2019s just too busy. I always felt rushed and needed follow ups.\nOur area is very short on physicians, made worse by the 2017 wildfires in Santa Rosa, CA[1] , where many physicians lost their homes in the Fountaingrove fire[2]. The fire completely destroyed a large wealthy neighborhood, along with over 1,000 other homes. Many doctors left the area.\nThis is where many doctors lived. In 2020, many homes have not been rebuilt.\nFootnotes\n[1] October 2017 Northern California wildfires - Wikipedia\n[2] North Bay Fires Damage Video: Fountaingrove Village Before and After", "Most people only have one criterion: The primary care doctor must be accepting new patients. It is excruciatingly difficult to find a doctor who is doing that.\nWhen there are two doctors taking patients, then they start looking at gender and race. By the way, I am not advocating for this, I am saying that this is what happens. There are a lot of FMGs who you can\u2019t even tell what the gender is by the name. People hate that, I know this to be true because people tell me. Awkward. But it is also kind of funny, so I just laugh because I didn\u2019t know, either.\nThe truth is that people choose me for a PCP more frequently when a photo is available. If they just have the name, they think I am probably Asian and can\u2019t speak English. The photo also shows that I am neither super young nor super old. People like \u201cexperience\u201d but not \u201cdementia.\u201d (All the oldsters are \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in and do not ever have to take an examination or have a memory test). The weird thing is that people tell me they chose me from the photo. Why would they share that information?\nThe other truth is that Asians choose me for a PCP more frequently when there is NO PHOTO because\u2026well, they are hoping I am Asian. Even if they speak Thai or Vietnamese and they know for sure that my name is not their ethnicity.\nIf the patient is Muslim, they will choose me over a doctor with a Hindu name, unless they feel very out of place in the US and are looking for a doctor who is an immigrant. And if Jewish, they sometimes think my name means, \u201clife\u201d in Hebrew. Well, it actually means, \u201cvegetable\u201d in Chinese, but who knew? So, religion sometimes is a factor.\nWomen often prefer female doctors. Actually so do men.\nBut the recommendation of family and friends is where most people make their decisions as far as I can tell. I don\u2019t think most people look at where you went to school or anything like that.", "I want a conservative doctor that isn\u2019t sending me for blood tests every month for no reason.

I qualify for VA health care. I had a VA doctor for a while, and\u2026let\u2019s put it this way. I used to think you had to be relatively intelligent to be a doctor. Then I met Dr. Smith*. I stayed away from the VA for a while, until something happened that caused me to want to see a doctor. I called up the VA, and they said I\u2019d been away long enough that I no longer had a doctor assigned and they could get me one in X amount of time. It was longer than I cared to wait, so I broke out my Tricare Reserve Select, the other health insurance I have from being a Navy Reservist. I started searching for doctors that take my insurance and found that Renown does. They have a nice web site where you can sign up as a new patient. You put in your location and preferred provider locations and the other thing they as is if you prefer a male or female doctor. I put in Carson City for a preferred location and \u201cno preference\u201d for a male or female doctor. I got matched up with a doctor I\u2019ll call Brett, since that\u2019s his name. I went in because I\u2019d been in a motorcycle accident and the Navy wanted me to go and get checked out. We accomplished this, and Brett sent me in for a few tests based on symptoms I was having. I\u2019ve had issues with doctors being pushy about things, but Brett was not like this. From taking a look at me, he correctly surmised that I lift weights heavy and often. He heard my heart murmur (on again, off again since I was 18), asked me a few questions about it, and managed to talk me into an echocardiogram by using Arnold as an example. It turned out fine, as I was expecting, but it\u2019s nicer being sure and the bill for me ended up being $0. TRS is good insurance. I\u2019ve been in to see him a couple times after that, and he always addresses the problem without going on tangents about other stuff.\n*Not his real name. I\u2019ve refrained from putting it because he has a similar name to a different doctor practicing in the same area with whom I have no experience.", "I look for a PCP nearby who is also within my insurance network.

Many people call prebiotics fertilizer for the bacteria in our gut. In simple terms, prebiotics promote the growth of good bacteria. Good bacteria in the gut boost better immunity.\nHow do prebiotics help with immunity? - Lymphoid tissues are the tissues in the body that support immune responses. The GUT associated lymphoid tissue is the largest in the body. So the gut is vital for immunity. Prebiotics can help with immunity by improving the conditions or the environment in the gut to promote better immunity.\nPrebiotics stimulate the \u201cgood bacteria\u201d in the gut. Examples of \u201cgood bacteria\u201d include Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli.\nShort-chain fatty acids (SCFA) - The good bacteria in the gut produce short-chain fatty acids like acetic acid, butyric acid, and lactic acid. Many people think of \u201cacid\u201d in the body as being bad. However, these short-chain fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects in the colon. They also provide the cells lining your colon with energy. Butyric acid is the primary energy cells for colonocytes (the cells lining your colon). SCFA lower the pH in the colon. The lower pH inhibits the growth of \u201cbad bacteria.\u201d The good stool has a lower pH and is high in SCFA.\nBacteriocins - Bacteriocins are \u201cnatural antibiotics\u201d secreted by the good bacteria of your gut, which inhibit or kill the harmful bacteria in your gut. Taking prebiotics enhances the growth of the bacteria, which produce bacteriocins and reduce or prevent intestinal infection.\nCytokines - Cytokines are substances secreted by the cells of your immune system. Some cytokines are PROinflammatory and increase inflammation. Some cytokines are ANTIinflammatory and reduce inflammation. By taking prebiotics, the good bacteria in the gut regulate the secretion of cytokines from gut lymphoid tissues. If you have an infection, the pro-inflammatory cytokines will be secreted to help you fight the infection appropriately.

It will be months before we see how this plays out.\nThat said, at this point, we must remember that COVID-19 is spread by travel. The nations that welcomed world travelers are the ones that took the hardest initial blows. For the most part, that is the wealthy countries. However, if you look at the countries that suffered the most deaths in relation to their populations, you will see that several smaller nations that serve as ports of call for cruise ships also suffered high fatality rates.

It is primarily the elderly with comorbidities and diminished capacity. In the west we are guilty of putting these people in tight accommodations with the least and most inexpensive staff possible.

That is nothing but using natural hand sanitizer spray\nand self-isolation which may keep us away from the virus.\nThe coronavirus is believed to spread from person-to-person mainly. Among people who remain in close touch with one another, others may get affected due to this virus.\nWhen we cough the respiratory droplets that come out from our mouth may fall on other's faces and they might also get affected. In this way, we might spread the disease to a lot of people.\nWhy Using Hand Sanitizer Is Important?\nSome of the health experts said that the best form to prevent the spread of virus disease remains by frequently using hand sanitizer. Another expert from Disease Control & Prevention suggests that people should clean their hands compulsorily after utilizing the restroom, after coughing & sneezing and before & after eating.\nAlso, they say that people should use hand sanitizer in the sense of no time to hand wash with soap and can use this for just 20 seconds. It takes less time to clean your hands without going anywhere from your place, and it is a handy product to use.\nUsing soap is better; that doesn\u2019t matter when the water is available with hot or cold. And the experts say using paper towels remains better than using air dryers which are used to prevent viruses from spreading.\nBut when you think soap or water isn\u2019t available, hand sanitizer is much better to be used that contains 60% alcohol which supports killing the bacteria which spread in your hands. If you take hand sanitizer with less than 60% alcohol, it doesn't work on every type of bacteria, or that may just overcome germs fairly than kill it.\nSome Of The Common Symptoms Of Coronavirus Are:\nCommon symptoms of this disease that presently keeps worrying the people include fever, shortness of breath, cough, and breathing difficulties.\nClean your hands, make sure to avoid touching the face, and prevent people who suffer from coughing & sneezing.\nGetting thirsty even if you drink more water may cause the virus, you need to go for a checkup with a doctor if you face these symptoms.\nTo overcome all these symptoms, you need to use the hand sanitizer which can be carried anywhere you want. Whenever you touch any unnecessary area, try to use the sanitizer which kills all the germs that are placed on your hands. Follow this sanitizer without missing it these days, especially try to guide your kids to use it and also tell them the reason why you should use it. So, they will be used without missing while they play in some unknown areas.\nIf you use this, you can be safe from cough and flu which are caused due to virus infection. With that virus infection, you may face a cough which may spread to all other people like that it passes some hundreds of people. That will be a problem these days. So, make sure to use hand sanitizer, which is fine without worrying about any issues.\nIf you are fine without any infections, we can reduce the virus which comes with that dangerous coronavirus disease which makes fear in most of the people nowadays.

It will last forever (a lot of salt comes out of mines, just like other minerals). Pepper comes from a plant. As others have said, it will start to lose some of its natural flavor and aroma after time. Throw it out when it no longer smells the way you want your pepper to smell. It will still be safe to use, though.\nBut let\u2019s talk about the meaning of \u201cexpired.\u201d \u201cExpired\u201d actually has no meaning when it comes to food products. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t actually see the word \u201cexpired\u201d very often. You are more likely to see \u201cuse by\u201d or \u201cbest by.\u201d\nSo food doesn\u2019t \u201cexpire,\u201d and it certainly doesn\u2019t expire on a certain date. Do you think that can of corn on your shelf was okay for 364 days and became toxic on the 365th?\n\u201cUse\u201d or \u201cBest by\u201d dates (which are required by the government, regardless of whether the item is really perishable) are generally the producer\u2019s conservative estimate of when the item will still have retained its quality. That can of corn will still be pretty much the same as the day it was canned, and not mushy and discolored. That box of crackers won\u2019t be stale.\nBut let me say this loudly: those dates have very little to do with whether the food is SAFE to eat. That depends completely on whether the food was prepared properly (i.e. not contaminated during the production process) and stored properly. If you leave your milk on the counter for a week, it\u2019s going to be bad regardless of the date on the package. If the distributor didn\u2019t refrigerate it properly, it could be bad before the date. If you contaminate something by putting a dirty utensil in it (or cutting it on a dirty cutting board) and then put it back in the refrigerator, it may be bad before the \u201cexpiration\u201d date. On the other hand, food that is stored properly \u2014 properly sealed and refrigerated \u2014 can be safe to eat for much longer than the \u201cexpiration\u201d date. Anything that is \u201cshelf stable\u201d won\u2019t \u201cspoil\u201d \u2014 it will just decline in quality over time (that box of crackers could be stale, but it\u2019s not unsafe). People throw out tons of perfectly good food every year because they are needlessly worried about \u201cexpiration\u201d dates.\nFinally, \u201cbad\u201d can mean different things. It can mean \u201cthis no longer tastes good\u201d for a product that is still safe to consume. It can mean \u201cthis has been in the fridge too long and it doesn\u2019t smell good\u201d \u2014 that might or might not make you sick if you ate it. Generally speaking, if it doesn\u2019t smell good, don\u2019t eat it (why would you want to, anyway?). But there is another kind of bad: bad because it contains pathogens, like salmonella or listeria. Those, unfortunately, you cannot smell, and they have very little to do with how the food was stored and mostly to do with the fact that it was contaminated in the production process. That chicken in your fridge that smells bad doesn\u2019t have salmonella just from being there a long time. It\u2019s unlikely it smells bad because it has salmonella, but if it does have salmonella, it\u2019s because it had salmonella when you bought it. I once got listeria from something I had bought at the store and eaten the same day \u2014 it was already \u201cbad\u201d when I bought it.", "Not in my opinion.", "Your salt is already a few million years old when you purchase it, so no.\nPepper, if already ground, begins to lose potency and aroma immediately \u2013 which is why \u201cwould you like some freshly-ground pepper on your salad?\u201d is a thing.\nWhole peppercorns are probably best if no more than a year old, but if kept in a vacuum-sealed container, can last for years.", "I have never checked the label on salt if there is an expiry date. As long as it is kept dry and in your cupboard my guess is that you will use it up before it ever expires.

This \u201capparently\u201d is important for this question, because we do not know yet at which non visible extent the body is reacting. I mean, the only usefulness of a vaccine could be to accelerate the immune response of your body. It is however seriously possible that this acceleration just helps the virus killing you.\nAfter something stranger enters your body, the standard reaction is twofold:\na) Generic (mostly, inflammation, temperature, and white blood cells that attack anything looking out of its place). Often this is enough to neutralise the threat. A nasty sore throat, a swelling near an insect bite or a small injure, are just that.\nb) Specific: triggered by the former, your immune system begins \u201cstudying\u201d the threat, and elaborates biochemical responses to it. This is what will definitely defeat the sickness, and leave a new entry in the database of your immune system, that will keep similar infections at bay.\nIn the case of covid10 you have two problems:\nI) The specific part of the response is rather slow.\nII) In the meanwhile, the generic part may kill you. It is the most frequent cause of death.\nThe role of the vaccine is to trigger a specific response of your immune system before you are infected. So the needed \u201cdatabase entry\u201d is ready before you are ever infected.\nBut the vaccine is a reduced form of infection itself, that will activate responses (a) and (b) as any other external threat. It must activate an immune response, it is exactly its duty. And some features of the covid19 biological attack must be present in the action of the vaccine, or the immune system will not develop the precise defences we need.\nSo, your body risks to face the sum of two dangerously similar infections at the same time, together with its own reactions to both.\nI am afraid that your question will be turned the other way round: when we have a vaccine, can we administrate it to somebody if we are not certain that they have not been infected already?\nAt present, the largest part of the infected ones does not develop a dangerous immune reaction.

Have you ever think that physical exercise can help you to get rid of these problems after reading this article you will definitely start thinking!\nExercise increases heart rate so more oxygen is pumped to blood and the brain receives more oxygen this triggers the production of endorphins, produces +ve feelings & reduces the perception of pain.\nIt reduces symptoms in people suffering from anxiety, promotes the release of a mood-lifting brain chemical called serotonin.\nImproves cognitive function and reduce the risk of dementia, Excercise also helps other body parts like skin, lungs, heart, immune system, muscle, bones, etc.\nIf you are still curious and want to explore more details in depth please continue reading\nWhile exercising, oxygen saturation and angiogenesis (blood vessel growth) occur in areas of the brain associated with rational thinking and as well as social, physical, and intellectual performance.\nExercise drops stress hormones and increases the number of neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, which are known to accelerate information processing.\nExercise upregulates neurotrophins (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor). These support the survival and differentiation of neurons in the developing brain, dendritic branching, and synaptic machinery in the adult brain (ibid).\nDecreased stress\nDecreased social anxiety\nImproved processing of emotions\nPrevention of neurological conditions\nEuphoria (short-term)\nIncreased energy, focus and attention\nHindrance to the aging process\nImproved memory\nImproved blood circulation\nDecreased \u2018brain fog\u2019 (inability of sharp memory)\nExercising enlarges the areas of the brain associated with memory, task management, coordination, planning, and inhibition (the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area).\nNeurons at different stages before exercise after regular exercise.\nThis enlargement means that the developed parts of the brain function faster and more efficiently. When you exercise, oxygen flow to these parts of the brain is very helpful.\nAnxiety is harmful to the brain, but how? Evidence exists that individuals who experience anxiety are 48% more likely to develop dementia. This is due to cortisol, the stress hormone, which damages parts of the brain involved in memory and complex thinking.\nA Look at How Exercise Reprograms the Brain\nAs we have seen, the brain is capable of producing new neurons. This is in part because of its neuroplasticity \u2013 its ability to continuously regenerate itself.\nWhen a person learns a new skill, interconnected neural circuits form and connect with each other through different points of contact (the synapses).\nOver time, if the person persists in the learning of that skill, the synaptic communication between the neurons will be strengthened.\nKolb & Gibb (2010) write how \u201ca better connection between the neurons means that the electric signals travel more efficiently when creating or using a new pathway. For example, when trying to recognize a new bird, new connections are made among specific neurons.\u201d\nA study conducted by Schoenfeld et al. (2013) articulates how exercise promotes the growth of neurons in the ventral hippocampus, so people who exercise tend to be able to handle stress better.\nWhat is the hippocampus, exactly? The hippocampus is a deep part of the brain responsible for learning and memory, and it seems to be activated during physical activity. A hippocampus of a person who lives a sedentary lifestyle consists of younger neurons. We can think of these as neurons as \u2018untrained.\u2019\nExercising immediately increases the level of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline neurotransmitters. The transposition of the three together results in hyperstimulation of the mind, which results in an increased focus of attention and reaction time, for at least two hours.\nHave you ever experienced a \u2018feel-good\u2019 sensation immediately after exercise? If so, you may have experienced the phenomenon known as the \u2018runner\u2019s high.\u2019 It is a temporary euphoric state that typically involves elated, contented feelings, and a general sense of well-being.\nOver time, consistent exercise will strengthen and enlarge the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, shielding against degenerative conditions.\nUltimately, Moderate exercise has a lot of benefits.\nMost of the info. are extracted from the article 10 Neurological Benefits of Exercise - PositivePsychology.com\nFor more knowledge please visit the article.\nImage Credit: PositivePsychology.com - Helping You Help Others\nInfo.

This research has been helpful for those with diabetes and allows them to eat a wider variety of foods while using stevia as a substitute for sugar. Not only is stevia a healthy choice for people with diabetes, but also for those who are watching their weight.

Studies have also confirmed that kaempferol acts as a chemopreventive agent, which means that it inhibits the formation of cancer cells.

Studies have shown that stevia prevents wrinkles, halts the signs of aging, reduces acne, fights dermatitis or eczema, and revitalizes the skin! The intake of normal table sugar causes glycation, in which sugar binds to the collagen in our skin and makes it become stiff and brittle. By switching to stevia, you are not only stopping the process of glycation and keeping the collagen from breaking, but it's also rich in antioxidants that protect our cells from free radicals.

It also contains most of the beneficial properties of stevia that are credited with the health benefits and is the most well studied.\nTo answer this question, it is important to differentiate between processed forms of stevia and the naturally occurring herbal form\n.\nStevia as the green plant that you can grow in your backyard or find as dried leaf or tincture form is considered safe and has even been studied and found to have health benefits.\nPowdered and bleached stevia, though FDA approved, has not been studied and undergoes an extensive chemical process to reach its final white powdered form\n.", "error", "Stevia is a natural sugar and sweetener substitute\nthat is extracted from the leaves of the plant species Stevia rebaudiana (which is a member of the chrysanthemum family). It is believed to have originated in Paraguay. It has zero calories, no carbohydrates and a glycemic index of zero.\nThere are generally three main types of stevia you can purchase: green leaf stevia (the least processed option), stevia extracts and altered stevia (like Truvia). You can use stevia to replace sugar in baking. With stevia, a little goes a long way. It is reportedly 100-300 times sweeter than table sugar.\nSounds too sweet to be true.\nLet\u2019s look more into the benefits of this natural sweetener.\n\u201cAlthough Stevia can be helpful to anyone, there are certain groups who are more likely to benefit from its remarkable sweetening potential. These include diabetic patients, those interested in decreasing caloric intake, and children. Stevia is a small perennial shrub that has been used for centuries as a bio-sweetener and for other medicinal uses such as to lower blood sugar,\u201d according to the National Institutes for Health\n(NIH).\nA 2010 study by the NIH found evidence that stevia lowered glucose and insulin levels in both lean and obese people. Recently, researchers\nexplained in some detail how stevia controls blood sugar levels. Study participants also reported to feel full and satisfied despite a low calorie intake.\nIn addition to this, a 2009 study\nsuggests stevia may help lower cholesterol.\n\u201cResults of intervention revealed that stevia extract intervention had positive and encouraging effects over lipid profile. No adverse effect was observed on the health status of the subjects and it can thus be concluded that the stevia extract intervention is effective in lowering the elevated levels of serum cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein levels and increasing the HDL levels,\u201d according to study notes.\nIn addition to this, several studies report stevia is rich in anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants that may help prevent cancer. It may even have antimicrobial properties and help fight bad bugs and infection.\nJust because a substance is natural does not mean it is safe. And there are some reported downsides to stevia.\nMost importantly, you have to be mindful of what stevia products you buy. Not all of them are created equal. Truvia, for example, has been reported to be chemically processed. Other stevia products may have sugar mixed in them in order to help mitigate some of the bitterness of natural stevia. So it\u2019s important to look for \u201c100 percent pure stevia extract\u201d on the label, not \u201cstevia powder.\u201d To learn more about additives often added to many stevia products on the market, click here\n.\nThere is also an NIH report\nthat suggested stevia may inhibit the growth of good bacteria in the gut.\nStevia may also interact with medications you may be taking, particularly medications you may be taking for diabetes, blood pressure and cancer. Talk to your doctor if you have any health issues and are interested in adding stevia to your diet.\nAt the end of the day, if you do use stevia it is probably a good idea to consume it in moderation.\nRemember, a little goes a long way.\nSource: Name Your Sweetener.

The problem with aspartame and saccharin is that they seem to raise blood glucose levels, which is not good for anyone with diabetes. Stevia and, I think, cyclamate, are thought not to do this. The BBC research tested stevia against aspartame but was not large enough to give a definitive answer. However, the results of the research were sufficiently strong to justify further research and convince me that the unverified observations about various sweeteners are probably true. I have decided to give stevia a go.\nI had bought stevia in the past but thought it tasted disgusting. Recently, I saw Canderel stevia tablets with \u201cnew, improved flavour\u201d written on the pack. They taste slightly different to Canderel aspartame tablets but they are definitely acceptable to my tastebuds.\nAs others have said, there\u2019s no evidence that approved artificial sweeteners do anything other than sweeten your drinks. The testing regime in all developed countries is very rigorous and I do trust them. The possibility that saccharin and aspartame could raise blood glucose is a fairly recent observation and has not yet been confirmed. For most people, this doesn't really matter but it would help diabetics to switch to stevia or cyclamate if further research confirms the early studies. It might be worth changing if there\u2019s diabetes in your family, even if you don\u2019t have it. Otherwise, like me, you might just be curious to see what it tastes like.

Also, if the tick is a nymph, its appearance will be different. This is not to say that other ticks don\u2019t carry diseases (they do) \u2014 just not Lyme (for example ehrlichiosis or Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever).\nAccording to the CDC (and FDA), the tick must be attached at least 24\u201348 hours before it is capable of transmitting Lyme disease. I am fully aware that there are individuals and Lyme disease advocates that believe disease can be established in <24 hours, or that as a result of being bitten they suffer from chronic Lyme disease, although conventional medical practice does not acknowledge chronic Lyme disease to exist. What is NOT in dispute is that the longer the tick is attached the greater the risk of disease transmission.\nAccording to a CDC report published in the January 2018 journal Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases, the probability of a host becoming infected with the Lyme-causing bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi) appears to increase to approximately 10% after a tick has been attached for 48 hours. The risk jumps to 50% after 63-67 hours, 70% by 72 hours and 90% for a complete feed.\nAny local population of ticks that can give humans Lyme disease can also give the same disease to dogs (after being attached for 36\u201348 hours) and the outcome can be devastating. For this reason, dogs that live in areas of high endemicity of Lyme disease should be kept from wooded areas or open fields and inspected by their owners daily, and owners need to become familiar with how to remove any tick found. The tick should be placed in a clear container and shown to the veterinarian. S/he will decide whether to submit the tick for identification and determination if it carries the Lyme organism as well as whether or not to empirically treat the dog.\nThere are EPA-approved pesticides that can be applied to a home lawn to decrease tick populations. Ticks prefer tall grass where there is typically higher humidity levels. Keeping the lawn mowed short promotes drying/lower humidity \u2014 an environment distinctly unpleasant for the tick.\nHow long does it take for an infected tick to transmit Lyme disease? - Daniel Cameron, MD, MPH\n6 Tick Diseases in Dogs\nResponses should be considered general in nature, and not specific to any one person; consequently, they are not to be construed as specific medical advice and do not create a doctor/patient relationship.

Make sure to do plenty of superman moves to activate muscles around your scapulae, in particular rhomboid muscles.\nNext with your fingers palpate your pec minor and try to find the area of point tenderness. At the point of tenderness first just hold the spot and breath into it. If you have a trigger point then the sensation might become intense and then go away after a short time. If you have scar tissue the pain will be dull and less point and more general around the area. If scar tissue go to next step.\nNow use cross fiber friction with your fingertips to stroke across the fibers. So you fingers will press in and move medial to lateral across the point. Repeat this and each time breath into the pressure and do the friction move as you exhale. You are seeking to break up scar tissue at the injury site.\nFollowing this lie on your back and try to protract your should blades activating your pec minor. If you have intense pain return to previous step and repeat cross fiber. If you don\u2019t feel intense pain then slowly let your shoulders fall with gravity.\nThe action of lowering your shoulder blades slowly is an eccentric lengthening contraction of your pec minor. Eccentric movements are key to aligning the muscle fibers. Do not perform any concentric movements until you can do eccentric sets without pain or inflammation.\nIf you don\u2019t get results then you need to start investigating your entire rotator cuff and all of the muscles in the shoulder region. Additionally you will want to review all of the muscles around your chest and breathing muscles.

If it continues at that pace it will kill 250k in one year. That is nothing like the annual flu.\nIf you mean once we've all mostly had it, or there is a vaccine for it, maybe. But there is considerable uncertainty right now as to whether immunity is maintained for long. So we may not get to the point of thinking of it as similar to the flu.", "It is unlikely. The corona type viruses are much less common than influenza viruses that regularly develop into new types each year. We may also be able to reduce the risks of corona type viruses jumping into humans.\nWhen this crisis is over we will be able to study corona type viruses in China and discover the source of coronavirus itself. It has most likely come from bat populations in China. Areas, where such bats live, could be isolated more effectively or possibly destroyed. And large amounts of money and resources will probably be made available to treat or prevent corona type viruses.\nIt is also likely that many people will be able to develop a more effective resistance to such viruses. This is fairly common.\nIt is also likely that when the source of the virus is discovered we will be able to find other deadly viruses in nature. We can then develop effective immunizations before people become infected. It is also likely that as children grow they will maintain a strong resistance to corona type viruses.\nWe still do not fully understand why some people are so resistant to coronavirus while others suffer badly. This will require considerable research to fully understand. But the fact that many people already have an effective immunity to the virus means we should be able to develop an effective immunization.\nBut coronavirus has been very unusual in its behaviors. There is plenty to be learned and we may find some very unusual characteristics. If coronavirus becomes very adaptive it could remain dangerous in future. But that is unlikely. It is very different to influenza. Though it has a number of similarities.\nIf coronavirus becomes highly adaptive we may not be able to develop effective immunizations. But that does not seem likely.", "Will the coronavirus end up being very similar to the flu?\nThat depends.\nIt is already much worse than the typical seasonal flu. The only reason fatalities have been held in check is because of the social distancing and near-lockdown. Without them, we\u2019d still be in an exponential rate of increase in cases and in fatalities.\nIs it going to be worse that your typical pandemic flu? Well, the last pandemic flu, the H1N1, pandemic of 2009 is estimated to have killed between 100,000 to 400,000 people worldwide in the first year alone. We currently sit at over 200,000 deaths worldwide, after 5 months. And this despite the social distancing and near-lockdown measures in a lot of the world. We have no vaccine. Those that were not infected in the first wave of the epidemic remain uninfected. It\u2019s hard to know where this is going but I think it\u2019s definitely going to be worse than H1N1. Don\u2019t forget, we had a vaccine for that.\nIs it going to be worse than the mother of all pandemics, the 1918 influenza pandemic? No. That one killed between 20\u201350 million people worldwide. And it was the result of increased worldwide travel \u2014 the main vectors were infected American soldiers traveling abroad, a virulent strain of the flu, and the realities of medicine circa 1918. That was a perfect storm that we are unlikely to ever see again.\nSo all in all, this is looking like this pandemic will mirror previous pandemics such as that of 1957\u20131958 (the \"Asian Flu\" caused by an A(H2N2) virus) and in 1968 (the \"Hong Kong Flu\" caused by an A(H3N2) virus, each of which killed between 1\u20134 million worldwide.\nA lot of it will depend on whether we can produce a safe and effective vaccine.

Typically a new vaccine is tried on mice, then if they don\u2019t curl up and die, researchers try a relatively small trial of monkeys, because as primates, they react more like humans than mice. If that proves safe, then they try two rounds of randomized controlled trials on human volunteers\u2014 a group that gets the vaccine and a group that gets plain sterile water ( or even the adjuvants and any stabilizers that are in the vaccine,,but no active ingredient). The first is usually fewer than 500 persons, total. The second is more like 5,000 -10,000 people. Then, if no problems occur in the large trial, they do another large trial for effectiveness, starting with people that have not been exposed, giving them the vaccine and then exposing them to see how well it works. Sometimes a second dose is necessary to achieve adequate immunity. At any point during any of these trials, unexpected bad side effects can pop up and shut down the whole process.\nRight now, Oxford University in the U.K. is through the primate safety trials and moving on to safety trials in humans. If there are no problems detected, that vaccine could be ready for approval as early as the end of September or beginning of October. If they guessed right on everything. ( They were already working on coronavirus vaccines in 2019).", "The vaccine may not be effective nor safe when given to diverse group of people. If a vaccine is found to be dangerous later on, this will cause the anti-vaccine movement to say do not receive a covid-19 vaccine. If people fear getting a vaccine, life can not return to normal easily as the anti-vaccine movement will have evidence to prolong the disease and possibly not allow humanity to ever eradicate the virus. So, it is extremely important that vaccines are proven safe and effective before it is manufactured in scale and given to the masses.", "To test a vaccine\nYou have to inject a lot of people with the vaccine OR a placebo and then expose them to the virus and then compare the results\nBecause of all the lockdowns\nBoth the control and the vaccinated groups are NOT being exposed to the virus\n\u2026\nwith so few people being exposed\nThey just can't know which vaccine is safe and effective\nThey have very very few data at all\nThe few data that they have is unreliable\n\u2026\nThey currently only have data from testing the vaccines on monkeys and mice\n\u2026\nIf they go ahead with choosing the best vaccine without human trial data\nThe worst that would happen is not only does the vaccine NOT work, it actually kills people or makes people MORE likely to have covid disease\nSo they want the vaccine to be tested on humans\n\u2026\nThe lockdowns are PREVENTING the vaccines from being tested, chosen and manufactured\n\u2026\nThere are talks of deliberately infecting both the control group and the vaccinated group with the virus\nthis will certainly hurt or even kill people, especially in the control group (unvaccinated people)\nResearchers will be sued for decades and may even be arrested\nSo that's not an option\n\u2026\nMany researchers are talking about testing their vaccines in Africa or India but the Africans and Indians are saying NO WAY\nThey don't want to be Guinea pigs and test subjects\n\u2026\nWith so many people staying home, There is very little progress in testing which vaccine is safe and effective\nThe longer the shutdown is, the LONGER it will take to test the vaccines\nSo the people demanding the shutdowns be continued and want a vaccine will need to wait for years and years", "You could miss a major size effect that causes tremendous morbidity or mortality in the patients to whom we administer the vaccine.

A virus is like a \u201csoftware patch\u201d that can change, corrupt or upgrade an operating software both in our bodies and in computers.\nHumanity will sooner or later will find an answer to the actual Covid-19 virus, even if it comes back with different, mutated forms. Still how Human society operates, how we develop from now on, that will change in a fundamental way.\nWe all know that this pandemic - though infecting a lot of people and taking tens of thousands of lives - is not the most severe blow Humanity had to cope with. Still it came at a unique intersection in our development which made this pandemic a turning point in Human history.\nSo far Human evolution was completely blind, instinctive, as we have been following our inherently selfish, egotistic nature, helplessly stumbling through recurring vicious cycles as - due to the constant, ruthless, exclusive competition, success, survival at the expense of each other - each cycles run into inevitable dead-ends and we changed - by tuning the actual civilization - when life became intolerable to a sufficiently large amount of people.\nWe can call this kind of development the \u201cpath of suffering\u201d, crisis situations, pain, suffering pushing us forward against our will.\nWhat we tend to forget a few weeks into this \u201cforced break\u201d is that our own, proud civilization - that's entirely built on excessive overproduction, overconsumption, measuring everything including Human beings through material possessions, material growth, GDP, stock exchange performance and celebrity status - was already in the verge of collapse.\nThe virus acted as if pausing our movie heading towards a Shakespearean ending, giving us an unprecedented review, overview of our past and present, providing the opportunity to prepare for the future.\nHumanity never had such a chance for review, as each civilization change unfolded in a frantic fashion, already aiming at the next ideology, system \u201cboldly destroying\u201d the present for the sake of the future. Our egotistic nature impatiently pushed us forward expecting even greater return, success from the next system.\nNow in this unique vacuum we are we - at least a healthy, awaken minority - can already see and understand that we can't simply waltz back into it \u201cold life\u201d, as if nothing happened. In the other hand we can also see that we don't have any more, attractive egocentric, self-serving new ideology, system that could entice us to change and move forward.\nWe have used all possible egotistic ideologies, systems together with all possible combinations of them, even now there are different \u201cexperiments\u201d going on - all failing.\nSo the virus \u201cput a new bug into our mind\u201d that suggests: from now on we need to focus on changing the Human being, the \u201cuser\u201d, rather than changing the governing, economic, social systems or the whole world around us.\nMoreover finally a large enough among of people recognized the perfect template we could go by, outside of our egocentric, subjective ideas, philosophies: Nature's perfect system.\nIf the awakened, aware, sensitive amount of people reaches the necessary \u201ccritical mass\u201d (about 10\u201315% if an actual society), then with the help of the right, purposeful and highly practical educational method we can initiate the necessary changes, upgrading, fine tuning our own software - initiated by the virus - to adapt ourselves to Nature's system.\nStarting from initially small, closed, mutually responsible, mutually complement, fully committed \u201ccells\u201d - that are ready to become the pioneers of the method - we can rapidly grow the necessary global network which will become the new - this time natural, solid and conscious - foundation for a global Human society.\nAs a result this new civilization will be \u201cNature-like\u201d, based on mutually responsible, mutually complementing Human interconnections, and an economic system following the optional balance between myself, natural, Human necessities and available resources.\nThen this new civilization will finally break away from the usual vicious, historic cycles, evolving, developing, growing together with Nature as partners.\nWhat Nature Wants From Us\nReopening the Economy? First, We Have to Change", "I think it's pretty evident that it does. However, it sure would be amazing if we could stop our polluting because of said diseases.

The inhumane, at present and for some time now, have been waging a quiet war against the humane. This war is very largely in the ways in which people can be adversely affected so as to be \u201cmanaged\u201d or eliminated on demand. How is this so?\nIt is so because diseases do not have physical causes as we are lead to believe. Even infectious diseases, where there is a physical pathogen, a virus or a bacteria, do no eventuate if our immune system is working to its full potential so as to fight the infection and maintain our health. The immune system is affected in stress, where there is some external danger or problem of some sort. In such cases the immune system is to some extent declined, depending on the level of fear. Thus an infected person\u2019s body is unable to fight the infection and hence falls ill.\nStress is also a factor in non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune diseases etc., and mental illness. To give you a few examples, I discuss cancer in two answers I have linked in this answer: Kyrani Eade's answer to How would you finish the sentence \u201cCancer is ______.\u201d?\nAnd here on bipolar 1. https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-cause-of-bipolar-1/answer/Kyrani-Eade\nIt is in the interests of the humane to group together and do the experiments required to prove ESP and telepathy because at present they are not done properly. See my answer: Kyrani Eade's answer to Since there are no actual signs of telepathy being real. Why do people attatch themselves to such a concept?\nAnd further to that to show that disease is a nocebo effect, i.e., a person\u2019s adverse bodily reactions to ideas being mentally presented to them by someone related, inhumane and who has an agenda. This will mean that humane people will be able to regain and maintain their health. It will also mean the inhumane will lose ground. There is no way they will be able to continue to adversely affect the humane population. This shifts the balance of power and with it quiet war is won by the humane. The outcome is that the inhumane will perish.\nThus humanity will be uniformly humane people, disease free and peaceful and happy, prosperous, co-operative and at the same time individual, expressive of vast diversity.", "Survival of self and survival of our race is a fundamental concern embedded in our brain so disease like the COVID pandemic can bring about large scale change in the behaviour of humanity.", "Yes, for example this deadly virus attacking our planet is changing us and not back like it was."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Adriana Moraes", "view_list": [60, 32, 2, 8, 89, 4, 2]}, "35": {"no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Maggie Mathis"], "question_title": "Why does water taste sweet and my tummy feel harder after missing my period?", "topic_list": ["Belly Fat", "Taste (sense)", "Drinking Water", "Menstruation", "Women's Health", "Obstetrics and Gynecology", "Pregnancy", "Health", "Medicine and Healthcare"], "no_of_view": "962", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [1], "ans_list": ["Anonymous, are you implying that you might be pregnant?

The oral, or \u201cactive\u201d polio virus is a small miracle.\nA weakened form of the virus is given to people. That virus can live in the gut of the person who is given the vaccine orally for, I think, about two weeks. While in a person\u2019s gut, that person sheds the weakened form of the virus, which can then spread to others nearby who were not vaccinated.\nThe result is that you get an immune response, somewhat degraded, in several people for every one you vaccinate. This works wonders, nearly miraculous wonders, in inaccessible populations (e.g. in areas with an active war).\nThere is a down side, because viruses mutate a lot. About one in 2,000,000 people how receive the OPV will come down with a case of polio because of this. Even worse, in extremely rare cases, that mutation has been known to be stable and able to be spread to others. That happens in perhaps 1 case in 200,000,000.\nA genetically mutated Oral Polio Virus is not the only strain of Type 2 polio in existence: the wild type 2 is extinct. Sadly, vaccine derived Type 2 polio virus is now by far the most common type of polio in the world. It is being eliminated by the same technique which was used to eliminate the wild Type 2: by vaccinating everyone, or very nearly everyone.\nFor the record, the mutated Type 2 which is now the only Type 2 which survive did so because conspiracy theorists did not believe in science, and did not follow the recommendations of healthcare professionals.", "The major problem with that theory is that a virus that is safe to catch may also be a virus that is impossible to spread. To engineer something that would spread effectively and provide the immune response without doing damage would be a feat for the ages.

Nonetheless, in some cases, individuals have numerous contaminations while they aren't legitimately identified with each other. These contaminations are regularly viewed as co-diseases instead of auxiliary diseases.\nFor instance, individuals can be co-tainted with both gonorrhea and syphilis. Those diseases aren't really identified with one another. Rather, they're both identified with comparative kinds of action.

Which STDs, and in this way the danger of co-contamination, relies upon which they're tainted with.\nInterestingly, if individuals become tainted with oral yeast contamination in view of HIV-related safe concealment, that is an alternate story. The yeast disease is just conceivable due to HIV contamination. Subsequently, it is viewed as auxiliary contamination or shrewd disease.\nThere is likewise a kind of co-contamination that is to some degree like an auxiliary disease. Some of the time an STD, for example, herpes makes individuals progressively defenseless to HIV. All things considered, the bruises brought about by herpes make it simpler for HIV to get into the body. At the point when an individual gets HIV in this situation, the lines become hazy. Most experts consider this co-contamination on the grounds that the HIV disease isn't legitimately an aftereffect of the herpes contamination.\nYou could put forth a defense for calling HIV obtained thusly an auxiliary disease, yet most specialists wouldn't. To some extent, this is on the grounds that most auxiliary diseases are treated nearby the essential contamination. Conversely, HIV is treated as its own different disease. It's additionally on the grounds that in this situation, it's not satisfactory that the individual wouldn't have gotten HIV at any rate. That is the significant contrast between auxiliary contamination and a co-disease. An optional disease can't occur without essential contamination. With co-disease, it's conceivable that the essential contamination simply made things simpler.\nReinfection\nReinfection with hPIV is less severe and typically causes cold symptoms\nin normal children and adults.
