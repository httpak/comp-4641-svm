He had a 3 year old daughter that lived in a separate state with her mother. Mind you when I met him he was in AIT in the Army and his actually family was scattered throughout two different states so as far as meeting anyone close to him that could call him out on his lie I didn’t have a chance. For a while things were amazing. He said that he had an amicable relationship with his child’s mother (They were never married… Important for the later part of this story) Him and I were friends on each others social media and I never saw her comment or post on any of his stuff and when we were together his phone wasn’t ever blowing up to make me believe any different from what he was saying. Well fast forward to the end of his training when he finally moved to the base he would be stationed at…. He ended up getting stationed at Ft. Sill which was about 22 hours away from VA. We decided to keep the relationship going and worked out how we would get to visit each other and all that jazz. He left VA at the end of November/ beginning of December. He was at his home base for a short period of time before he let me know that he was going to be deployed to Korea soon and he wanted to see me before he deployed. I drove 22 hours straight to Oklahoma and saw him the week before and of Christmas. I left Oklahoma on the 22nd because I wanted to spend Christmas with my family and he said that he was going to be spending it with his daughter. Well during the time we were dating I can only guess that his childs mother figured out who I was or wanted to be nosy so I noticed that she had popped up under the “People you may know” on Facebook right at the top. I didn’t think much of it because I just assumed he had finally told her that we were dating since he “claimed” his family knew who I was as well. Well Christmas day I was on Facebook and doing my usual scrolling and ended up getting a friend request which prompted me to look at the “People you may know” since it is on the same screen and I saw that her last name had changed to his last name! I freaked out and I contacted him and went off! He said that she just had false hope and she was crazy and I shouldn’t go off of what I see on Facebook. I calmed down after a few days and we stayed together. Mind you there were other small hints in between this happening that I ignored but now looking back I see that I shouldn’t have… Then a week or so later I start getting notifications from my Pinterest and of course I look to see that she was pinning things from my Pinterest to hers… I chalked it up to being her being petty until I realized she had stuff posted showing that SHE MOVED IN WITH HIM! To make a long story short… They were together the entire time and I was nothing more than a side piece. I ended up contacting her and telling her everything and she decided to stay with him because of what he could offer her and because he was in the Army (her words, not mine) and because of the benefits she wanted another child with him. Come to find out he was also seeing another girl that I had no clue about as well…. Them being together didn’t last long before he ended up kicking her out when he got back from Korea and sending her back to live with her mom, they stayed married and ended up splitting the benefits so he could live on his own and cheat in peace and she still didn’t have to work and now that he is out of the Army they are no longer together or have any dealings with each other and he ended up cheating on her with over 10 women, many of them were during the period they lived together (which was a very short period of time) and were in the home and bed they shared together.', 'upvote': 2, 'view': 101, 'date': 'Mar 28, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

I would ask you today to evaluate what you want from a partner, if this partner is providing that, and whether you can see yourself happy with them in 5-10 years if the emotional rollercoaster continues (or gets worse, because more than likely-IT WILL).\\nA HEALTHY/NORMAL relationship is supposed to include the following things:\\n1-Respect for each other: You don’t have to have everything in common to have a healthy relationship—but you do need to respect each other enough to work together when your personalities or backgrounds conflict.\\n2-Trust: You should both be behaving in ways that reassure each other that you are committed to each other and the relationship.\\n3-Communication: You should feel free to speak your mind and feel heard. If you are afraid to bring up something that bothers you, hurts you or upsets you, then that is not healthy.\\n4-Healthy Boundaries: In a healthy relationship each person knows and respects the other’s boundaries. Ignoring those boundaries and pushing the other person too far is one of the fastest ways to destroy trust and ruin a healthy relationship.\\n5-Security: You should never feel afraid or threatened. Both partners should have anger control, and be able to argue or fight respectfully if issues or differences arise. No name calling or belittling should be tolerated on either side. (This is verbal abuse)\\n6-Compromise: Every couple fights, and both will be expected to compromise at some point, put in effort and work together to RESOLVE issues and MOVE FORWARD STRONGER AND MORE CONNECTED.\", 'upvote': 4, 'view': 79, 'date': 'Apr 1, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

The first month was great. Great sex, lots of attention, and I felt great! Then I found out she was making other guys feel the same.\\nIn another instance, I was single and pursued another woman I felt was quite attractive. Well she was very attractive, but didn’t have a great personality. We often clashed. We barely began dating before I got sick of her.\\nWhile in another relationship, a woman who I deemed to be a bit less attractive than my current partner caught my attention. We met as friends, joked about hooking up and having wild sex adventures. Let’s call her Linda. After having a meaningless argument with my then girlfriend, I left and ran to Linda. We had wild sex, but it wasn’t long before we realized that our sexual desires were incompatible. Or rather to be clear, I didn’t want phallic objects inserted into my anal cavity.\\nLast but not least, while single yet again and on a dating sight, I connected with a VERY VERY attractive woman. She was an actual model. I didn’t think it would go anyway, but shot my shot anyway and it worked! The problem there was she was frequently traveling, so I wouldn’t see her very often. She also traveled with her male best friend who was also a model — really cool guy. I later found out that she did not cook what so ever, so anything she ate was cooked for her or she ordered. She was also the type to run away from conflict, so when we had a disagreement, she’s change the subject and run away. But the straw that broke the camels back was when I was hanging out with her male best friend one day. In the midst of hanging out, he bent over to get something and his boxers caught my attention. Jokingly I said “Those boxers must be popular, Gina wears that same brand from time to time.” He laughed and said “she needs to stop stealing them from me.”. Ummm what?!\\nLong story short, she’d frequently wear her male best friend’s boxers and shirts, especially to sleep in. When she told me she had feelings for him but he would never act, I took my leave.\\nMoral of these stories, the grass is not always greener on the other side. You’ve put in the time and effort to get to know your current partner. You know many of their likes and dislikes, you know mostly how they think and how they’d react, and you’ve worked to build a foundation. Why trash all that to try your luck with someone you know nothing about except that they’re attractive?\\nHear me out. It’s like playing BINGO and having 4 spaces filled with 1 to go to make a straight and completely line, then throwing your BINGO card away to obtain a new card to start again from scratch.

Want to lose the weight? Begin by engaging in a more active lifestyle as a couple - walking, riding bikes, weight training, adopting better eating habits. Spend less time on the couch and more time together doing physical activities you both enjoy. Otherwise, you’ll both likely continue to pack on the pounds.\\nJust so we’re clear - there’s nothing wrong with that if you’re both happy about it.

If that offends anyone, too bad. People seemed to get upset I even asked the question for reasons I can only guess. One guy calls me childish for asking a question that he couldnt answer because if you say…women bring sex to a relationship [heterosexual] somehow that's derogatory because the feminists among us keeps telling women that their value is not in their sexuality.

This is not surprising given the fact women have the babies and initiate divorce over 70% compared to men\\nOver the last 40 yrs we have had a declining birth rate beginning with the higher educated women. Female happiness is at an all time low as more and more women are indoctrinated to believe masculinity is toxic. At the same time women are exhibiting male behavior. They sleep around. Put off marriage and kids..become lawyers and other high up on the pay scale careers. Then all they have to look forward to is 80hr work weeks and a bunch of cats. Stress and debt then they quit. Not everyone but the majority do.\\nMen bring resources to a relationship. Women now out earn men in many job markets and they are getting all the college degrees. Women typically dont mess with no Broke Broke man lol. So let's review. Men marry for steady access to sex. Its alot of work to get laid you know. It's not like we men get a whole lot of sex without time and effort. Women are the gate keepers to sex mostly. Women marry for stability and stability is resources.

If you haven’t healed or had enough distance from the apex of toxicity- then the freshness of the feelings can spoil any potential to resolve the relationship.\\nEnd it if one person is pulling all the weight. Healing a relationship needs to be mutual. It cannot be one sided. This just generates new layers of toxicity.\\nThere is more negative than positive.\\nThere are not consistent signs that give you hope/optimism about the relationship. Rebuilding trust and health in a relationship takes a LOT of effort. There needs to be patience and understanding that healing toxicity is not an immediate of quick process. So there needs to be daily investment, and clear sings that both parties are working towards something better.\\nThe goals are vague. You need to decide what a healthy relationship looks like, and be very specific about what dynamics need to change. If you’re at 0 (toxic), and want to get to 100 (healthy), then that’s awesome. But define what that “100” looks like, otherwise making progress towards a 5 might be taken as evidence that the work is done. And it’s not. 5 is still toxic if 100 is healthy. So celebrate the baby steps, but don’t mistake a moderately less toxic relationship as a healthy one.\\nYou need to be on the same page about what needs to change- both in terms of the dynamic, and how you interact. If one person is stubborn and identifies with their toxic traits- then healing isn’t going to happen. Toxic traits emerge from experience, and they are usually protective mechanisms. So it takes a lot of inner work and healing to resolve. Patience is needed, but the desire to overcome those traits is also needed. If someone doesn’t want to heal- they just want you to accept their toxicity- this is a losing battle.\\nIf one partner refuses to take responsibility for contributing or enabling the toxicity. It may be the case that one party feels like the victim. And they may have been victimized. But what needs to change on their end- is to stand up for themselves. To enforce their boundaries. To handle conflict better without submitting. And to not stay attached to the victim identity as a way to gain power through guilting their partner. You cannot identify with the past- use it to inform the present, but don’t bring it with you.

It’s easy to be nice to someone when things go your way because you don’t have to adjust/give up or compromise anything.\\nBut a relationship is all about sacrifices and compromises WHILE MAKING SURE both people are unharmed physically and mentally. It’s very important to make sure of this.\\nFor example: If he puts away the clean washing (laundry for those who aren’t familiar), you should do the dishes. If he’s vacuuming the place, you can fix the meal.\\nSomething so that both your efforts are evened out.\\nIt’s not all you working your job and get getting home to do all the dishes, fix meals, folding and keeping the clean clothes as well as vacuuming the place while he just comes home from work at sits down to watch his favourite show while demanding dinner. ( This is an old stereotype but I have seen this very prevalent in many houses. No offense to men, we all know not everyone is like this.)\\nIn the same way, it’s not him managing his job and then getting back home to struggle with everything while you just leave saying “Honey it’s girls’ night out!”\\nOf course you can go, but not before making sure you did your share of the work.\\nSo if he or she can’t accept it when things don’t go their way, and has to RESORT to belittling or hurling things at you, then they are spineless pathetic excuse of partners.\\nNot only that but also immature. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable from a 5 year old (who stomps his feet, throws things and tantrums if he wants something) so what makes the other person think this is okay?\\nA word of advice for you , please be careful. Such type of people easily retort with violence and try to make you feel insecure (which is bs because they’re the insecure ones and they want to bring you down with them) and I hope you do not get hurt. If they hurt you physically , it’s not right, they may apologise for it later saying they weren’t in their “right mind”.\\nHow many times can you excuse that? Once? Twice?\\nThere’s nothing called “right mind”. If you are always supposed to do things for them and make them feel comfortable without caring about your “right mind” then the least they can do is be supportive and thankful about it.\\nAnd if this kind of behaviour continues , you need to seriously consider ending this unhealthy relationship.\\nHe or she won’t change even when you have a little family, and next thing you know, the abuse is hurled not only at you but also the children. It impacts little minds in a much different way than ours and traumatises them for life. There’s no need for that.\\nA lot of relationships hide abuse under the mask of perfection.\\nPlease be careful of who you choose to live with.\\nGood Luck.\\nPlease upvote if you like my content <3', 'upvote': 0, 'view': 40, 'date': 'Apr 1, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': ['Abuse', 'Relationships', 'Manners and Etiquette', 'Relationship Advice', 'Understanding Human Behavior', 'Dating and Relationships', 'Human Behavior', 'Interpersonal Interaction']}\n",

And, of course, I would very likely wait to go on a real, in-person date with someone until after the second wave that will come after the quarantines are all lifted too early.

The moon rising in Sagittarius during a lunar eclipse? To what purpose?\\nIf I had to say that I waited for anything, it would be for their consent. Without their consent, a relationship doesn’t happen. But if I don’t have their consent, I don’t really “wait” for it, in the sense of them saying no and me pretending to be their friend while scheming to make them love me. If they aren’t interested, I let them go and I move on. I don’t sit around pining after people who don’t want to be with me. I just don’t *do* anything to them without getting their consent first.\\nSo, I might wait a few moments between “I really like you, may I kiss you?” and actually kissing them, depending on how long it takes them to give me an answer one way or the other.

Since they are very similar in certain aspects, for instance:\\nThey both walk to their own song.\\nThey both have a strong inner moral code.\\nThey both are all about the results and the performance.\\nTherefore, they share high camaraderie for being so similar, yet they have at the same time low compatibility with each other for being so similar. It’s very difficult for them to communicate with each other, for instance\\nFor instance, ESFPs unconsciously use non-verbal reading a lot, but INTJs are natural poker face.\\nThey will have a hard time meeting each other in the eyes if they have very different values.\\nThey are both very individualistic and egocentric.\\nThey can sometimes both compete to be the center of attention.\\nSince they value things in different orders, that can also cause some tension, by example:\\nI find my mother to focus too much on what is good or wrong; she constantly passes on value judgments upon people and is utterly unaware of her own moral transgressions. On the other hand, she reproaches me to be a cold intellectual.\\nESFPs are all about subjective truth (Ti trickster) whereas INTJs are all about objective truth (Fe trickster)\\nShe reproached me to be too much in my head (Ni hero) and I reproach here to be too expansive (Se hero).\\nSince they both are each other's subconscious; they aspire to be like each other. There’s definitely a great pedagogical relationship between polar opposites, for instance:\\nINTJs can learn how to live in the moment (spontaneity) whereas ESFP can learn strategical planning.\\nINTJs can learn how to be expressive and ESFP can learn when to actually shut up and listen.\\nINTJs can learn to mature their inner feeling and ESFP can learn how to mature their outer thinking.\\nThere’s high respect between both types, but I would recommend a casual relationship between both of them. Whatever they do, they should avoid roommate and loving relationships.

The partners come to expect certain things from the other and it doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t appreciate your efforts, it’s just that they forget to mention it. Sometimes, we even “train” our partners to take us for granted. We do this by anticipating their wants or needs and take care of things without being asked. If our partner does mention it, we often tend to minimize it. “Oh, it was no big deal. I don’t mind doing it.” The way around this is to talk about it. Let your partner know you’d like some acknowledgment for your efforts. Tell them it makes you feel happy when they tell you that they appreciate you. Make sure that you model the treatment you’d like to receive by praising and thanking your partner, too.\\nLack of emotion and lack of affection are often the result of a communication lapse. It’s also true that different people show emotion and affection in very different ways. For example, a partner might think they are showing you affection when they shovel the walk before you go to work. If what you really wanted was a hug and a kiss, you’ll probably feel short-changed by the snow free sidewalk. Your partner is going to be confused when you don’t see his act of kindness as an expression of his affection for you. You actually have quite a bit of control of this area because you can initiate a hug without an invitation! You can snuggle up and say, “Oh, you just give the best hugs! I feel so loved when you hold me!” You can encourage your partner to be affectionate by being affectionate and by making positive comments when they reciprocate. The other thing you can do is to simply accept that is the way your partner is and try to recognize other ways they show their feelings for you.\\nRespect, on the other hand, is nearly impossible to “teach” someone.

You must really trust him. It’s hard to be vulnerable with people so you’ve made a big stride forward in dealing with your childhood experiences by doing this.\\nI believe the issue you’re having is that you’re communicating by text. Text messages are best for quick conversations “does 5pm work for you?, “can I borrow your notes?” Or lighthearted conversations “how was your day?” “Did you see the new episode?” Serious or complicated conversations are best over the phone or in person. These kinds of conversations need added signals like body language, inflection in your tone, and the emotional expression on your face. Over text words can be read with many different emotions and emphasis. All this to say it’s entirely possible your boyfriend has no idea how serious you were being, if you were sad or angry. It’s very hard to process and understand how someone is really feeling when you are simply reading their words. If it were easy to convey specific emotions and intentions through text everyone would be a successful author :)\\nIts also possible it was too much information and too serious for him to process or handle and he’s backed away. Hearing something very serious about your partner can be difficult, and he’s trying to understand and process it alone. Maybe he thinks you over shared and he wasn’t ready to hear something so intimate about you. Maybe he’s confused and unsure of why you told him. Maybe he’s never heard a story like yours before and has no idea how to react. There’s lots of possibilities here. But to find out you need to talk to him in person (from the appropriate distance) or over the phone. Call him and explain why you told him, that you trust him, and then tell him how you’d like him to react. Do you want him to just listen and comfort you? Do you want practical advice? Do you want him to open up more about his life? When you’re having a conversation remember there are two people involved. It’s not just you talking to a wall. This is a person with free will and choice. Understand that even though you are ready to open up, he might not be ready for that. You should give him the choice to say so. He may say “this is too much for me, I am dealing with enough.” Maybe that is not what you want to hear but it’s best you give him the space to be honest.\\nRegardless, your boyfriend isn’t meeting your expectations but you didn’t make it clear what those are. call him and say “it worrried me you didn’t text me back, it’s better to talk about this over the phone.

This can happen to anybody if expectations and standards are set/driven/measured wrong way or without any base.

The worst- with an INFJ.\\nAn ENTJ found me at the top of my game, I was flying in college, was volunteering, on a research team and a leader for organisations I was in charge of. I really had pulled myself out of a rough patch and I was proud. However; I didn’t realise how LONELY I was until my ENTJ came along.\\nmy ENTJ, as cheesy as it’s going to sound showed me what love is. I’d never had anybody stay with me before, I had been conditioned by a very toxic INFJ to expect the absolute worst from people, leaving me with abandonment fears and tremendously horrific anxiety. It’s enough to make most people run.\\nNot my ENTJ, she was patient and kind. She saw past the ENFP fuzzy warmth and ditzy smile and saw depth. She stood by me and held my hand when I broke down in tears apologising for how messy I was. She listened to my stories, how I saw things and was fascinated by it, she showed up each time I thought ‘‘there’s no way’. She understood the reasons as to why I did things and she taught me about love selflessly, she pointed out when I was getting down on myself, she pulled me out of self destructive loops. Not in a way I was dependent on her; but in a way where she taught me I could do it; just by myself. I didn’t NEED to depend on her, but I could lean on her when times got tough. I started to see myself differently, I saw myself for the first time in my life someone who was worthy of respect, worthy of….love.\\nNot only from other people but self love too. She also didn’t allow me to indulge in my push or pull tendencies, she made it clear that she wasn’t going to put up with me acting out and it was because of the self respect she had for herself too. I admired her and respected her; and she respected me in a way that made me feel truly loved. It took patience….A LOT OF PATIENCE. But she taught me so much about the love I want that well, i’ll never forget her. I think the true value of love comes from two people who encourage the other to value and respect themselves, as my ENTJ said once; “I hate to break it to you, but i’ve met some of the people who hurt you and they knew what they were doing when they did it. They know the effect it would have on you, so stop making excuses. If someone hurts you again and again don’t search for the good stuff in them, move on. Find people who love you. I hope you know that i do.”\\nI’m an ENFP by the way, and on some days I really do struggle to believe that anyone loves the me that only she’s seen, but it gives me hope.

So you work in extreme fluctuations - when you are talking to them, you can even end up having an intimate conversation with them. On the other hand, when you are in the zone of pushing them away, you would not even say Good Morning to them even if they pass you by. This is the major reason why a lot of people end up ghosting each other. Basically, it is their psychology and old wounds talking.\\nPush Pull Technique Two:\\nThis is basically a meditation practice in which you attract someone towards yourself through the power of your Chakras and aura (pull) and if there is someone you want to get rid of, you release your bonds with them and send their energies back at them (push).

I Have stated many times over that the secret to a successful relationship is compromise. When I say this it means for example, say I want to go fishing for awhile and want my wife to let me go with friends on a trip. How do I accomplish this feat? Well I know that there is a ballet or opera coming up she wants to attend but I don't because I think its boring but i need to think of her interest and needs and do the things she wants in order to get her to mutually meet my needs and interest. That is what I mean by a compromise, by not being selfish or self centered. I never compromise on a conflict or argument, especially if it means my morals or values are at stake. I Don't care how much it pisses off my wife. What I will do is listen carefully to what she says, get her opinion on the matter and offer my opinion. Of course sometimes its impossible to work out a solution but we at least try to work out something. It sounds like every time you have an argument its with someone who doesn't listen to or value your opinion so I'm guessing by compromise you mean the conflict altogether never gets resolved and you never really get your point across so you end up dropping the issue. By now after dealing with this for awhile you are feeling disrespected and resentful. It might be at a point where your partner needs to hear from an independent third person's view such as a councillor. Hopefully he is willing to go or put in some effort otherwise its pointless. If you want you can personally reply to this so i might be able to help more in depth. I Hope this answer helps a little.

Why is this world emotionless and relationships are becoming fickle, the social needs of man make him prey of loneliness and depression? Why God created emotions in a man?', 'answer_count': 1, 'create_time': 'Sep 10, 2018', 'question_author': 'Veena Kabtta', 'no_of_follower': 2, 'no_of_view': '1,397', 'respond': {'0': {'user_name': 'Kālī Prasāda Dāsa', 'answer': 'জয় মা কালিকা তারা !\\nI believe we have emotions and the desire for a relationship, only to relate to God. It is like this - if we are thirsty, no amount of soda or drinks, hard or soft, can satisfy us - temporarily maybe, but ultimately we need water.\\nA fickle person is just as much on his search for God as is a steady person. It is just that the fickle one has not found a close match to God and the steady one found somebody similar to his God. But all relative relationships will wither away some day or the other, because “similar” is not “same”. Ultimately the heart and the soul will not tolerate any shortcoming in relationships. All these relationships in this world are like passengers on a train. If you like the person sitting beside you, you make a connection - a temporary one, otherwise you stay quiet. At the end of the journey everybody will disperse to their respective destinations. It would be foolish to give your heart to a person you just met in the train. We think we know a person by living with them for long, but what is a matter of hours in a train is the same as decades on this earth - by the end of the journey we are none the wiser about the other person. The only person we know is ourselves and our own thoughts, desires and aspirations - which may change but we don’t blame ourselves generally because we are implicitly privy to the justifications for such change and which others probably would never understand. That gives a clue to God - the eternal companion - this is the real deal - God is the one before whom you stand stark naked - it is not vulnerability, but the relief we have always sought - the one who knows everything — but without judgment and with all empathy and love in existence poured unto you.\\nWhy are we created like this? This is a question that has troubled philosophers, religionists, spiritualists and scientists alike.\\nI think we end up on earth or in separation from God just to ignite this flame of desire for God - to wake up maybe, from the dead, to live eternally in the highest heavens in everlasting joy, relating to ones perfect God.', 'upvote': 2, 'view': 79, 'date': 'Apr 7, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': ['Relationships', 'Theology', 'Spirituality', 'God', 'Love', 'Religion']}\n",

The “should” in this question is a bit of a misnomer.\\nKnowing about your partner’s past does teach you a lot about them. It can tell you who they’ve usually been attracted, why their relationship ended, and what you can expect in a relationship. Additionally, they may share stories of how they’ve grown or what alterations they’ve made when it comes to approaching romantic relationships.\\nSo in a way, a general knowledge about your partner’s past can be useful, and it can offer you insight into their experience, and possibly foreshadow what to expect.\\nHowever, if you want to know about their past in detail- and if you are the type to overthink, self-doubt, and are easily made insecure- then knowing about your partner’s past is not in your best self interest, and it is also not useful for the relationship. While you can listen to their experiences to get an idea of their past- this does not neatly predict how the relationship will unfold.\\nSo if you learn about their past and it becomes an obsession, or a point of lowered self esteem- I have seen people manifest the thing that they fear most.\\nFor example- if you anticipate something catastrophic in your relationship, this generally means you pull out a bit. You act distant, suspicious, and pre-emptively contemptuous. Or, you may have suspicions when there is no reason to be suspicious. This can create all sorts of unhealthy dynamics.\\nSo evaluate your reasoning for wanting to know someone pasts. A final note- is that some personality types are manipulative and controlling. And some partners who have narcissistic traits may pry about your past as a means to control you. If they know what you have tolerated- they will know how far they can push your boundaries. Additionally- I have had clients experience partners who threatened to blackmail them with personal information, or use that information to shame them.\\nSo it is again important to be clear about your motives for knowing someone’s past. And it is important to know the ways it may benefit or act as a detriment.\\nTo give a personal example- my partner and I once played the “20 question game”, late at night since we couldn’t fall asleep. We both revealed particular details about our past. We both ended up feeling hurt, and knowing information that was really not beneficial to know. Long story short, we can joke about it now- but for a while it became a real point of insecurity- to have particular moments of our previous relationships revealed.

Things that blame you for wanting to be in a relationship. But most of it implies you are entitled to a relationship. If you do these things, you'll be worthy of dating someone. But when is enough? How many mountains do you have to climb or languages learned before you've improved yourself enough?

You're content. That means you don't feel lacking in anything and aren't looking for anything.

At the same time, looks have nothing to do with it: being good looking really buys you that critical first 10 seconds.

Obviously there will people who claim to have a sex life when they are 75 but they are the exception or lying. Life typically goes as follows; boy and girl meet, fall in love, get engaged and get married, and by the 1980s most girls were not virgins like me but it was something their mums always wished for. Forgetting any pre marital sex, after the wedding and now hopefully living in their own home, the average couple would really have the best sex of their lives. With just the two of you, sex could be without inhibition, more or less when you wanted it and were you wanted it; I think we did it in every room, the stairs and the car. The stockings and suspenders and brief knickers, the role plays, the spanking, the running naked around the house all remind me of getting dripping wet, with the expectation. You could dress up, go out clubbing, go for a meal and come home with no knickers and make some noise and scream at orgasm.The absolute best time for this period is in your 20s, as you have the energy. So this regular sex carries on for an average of seven years, which is the time couples may be struggling to get their own home, and build a work career. This can put pressure on the relationship for couples now in their early thirties. Sex is less regular due to external pressure of work but in some respects can be due to the ‘ been there done that feeling‘ of boredom in the bedroom. Sex becomes routine, and is a struggle to keep regular. It might vary from being a job of work, to still being passionate but just a little less often. Sadly, the marriage can either end here with the seven year itch, as either party goes off with a younger person, or the real love and affection comes out and the couple recognise that they should have the children they want some day. While the sex will never be the same as the 'dripping wet’ orgasmic fun it used to be, the couple who stay together now replace a certain amount of passion for monthly charts and thermometers and him having to have lots of sex either side of ovulation day! The children are born which gives the couple a new purpose in life and this hopefully carries on until their are brothers and sisters to care for. While kids are small and in bed there is some time for some sex but not anything too wild, so as not to wake the kids. Once the kids grow and start to question things and by the time they are teenage, its nearly impossible for mum and dad to get it together, and extremely embarrassing for the kids to listen through the walls as mum starts to make some noise on orgasm. About this time in the marriage, medical matters conspire to reduce the sex, such being overweight or arthritis, or the need for viagra, or the need for a hysterectomy, so sex is almost dead, and the marriage continues in for the companionship and the support they give as grandparents. This might seem a sorry tail and give a depressing outlook for the future but sadly it is very nearly the same for everyone. Incidentally it annoys me when they interview a couple who have been married 70 years who say they have never had a disagreement. They have had a marriage based on one party rule and no dissension in the ranks! My advice therefore for couples starting out is to have more sex, as after the initial years it is so easy to be distracted and think tomorrow is another day, when in fact there is a vagina next to the guy in bed waiting to be used!\", 'upvote': 0, 'view': 86, 'date': 'Apr 10, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': ['Sexuality and Relationships', 'Sex and Sexuality', 'Relationships and Sex', 'Relationships', 'Sex Advice', 'Sexuality', 'Adult Dating and Relationships', 'Sex', 'Relationship Advice', 'Dating Advice']}\n",

Perhaps you can shift the way you approach and think about dating so that everybody can be happier. There’s a lot of intermediate steps in between being strangers and being in a relationship that are worth thinking about and adapting to your needs.\\nThe first one that comes to mind is you don’t need to be in a relationship in order to be dating. In order to make this work you need to be clear with the person that you’re not ready to be exclusive and you’re both free to see other people. You need to set and communicate boundaries, for two main reasons.\\nFirst, you need to not see the other person more than once a week or so. If you don’t follow this rule it starts to feel like an unacknowledged relationship and guaranteed somebody’s not getting what they need from that but will feel stuck. I’ve made this mistake, I have to keep my hot female friends at arm’s length now.\\nSecond, you need to keep physical intimacy to that which you’re comfortable with, and encourage your casual partner to do the same. Some people can have sex outside of a relationship, some people can’t. Don’t feel pressured to, and don’t date men who pressure you. Warn them a few times then get out.\\nBut there’s a lot more to physical intimacy than just putting the sausage in the bun. I can turn women into putty with my massages, and I’ve had to learn to hold on to those while dating. Don’t be so quick to give it all away! Dole your gifts out for good behavior, don’t be afraid to tease! Make it a game, how people act in games is super-close to how they act when it’s serious.\\nGuaranteed the person you’re seeing isn’t going to be perfectly happy with what they’re getting / not getting out of their time spent with you. That’s okay! It’s not a relationship! When you’re dating, you don’t have to meet anybody else’s needs other than your own! If your partner has trouble with boundaries, you can talk about it, but chances are that means they’re not going to work that well in a relationship.\\nIf you can’t have fun when you’re just dating, you won’t have a whole lot of fun in a relationship either.', 'upvote': 0, 'view': 44, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

Empathize with the reader.\\nDo your best to understand the other person’s side. What might they have felt to behave that way? What untold struggles have they been facing?\\nBy bringing this up, you’ll make the other person feel important and you’ll both find common ground.\\n3. Share support\\nYou should say what you expect from this relationship in terms of behavior and support. What can you do to help each other? Are your goals aligned?\\nIf you follow these 3 steps, you’ll set a neutral environment to address the issue and the reader will most likely become less defensive.\\nHowever, lasting relationships are not only about resolving conflict but also about nurturing.\\nSo let me show you how to write a letter to express gratitude and appreciation.\\nPaint the scenario\\nFirst of all, you should write an introduction to grab the reader’s attention and make him or her want to read the letter.\\nHere you’ll write something that you know the person would agree with you, whether it is a background story about what you’ve been through together or a fun fact about your relationship. But the reader has to think “Oh yeah, that’s true!”\\n2. Say what you admire about the other person.\\nThis is a good exercise even to you because by thinking about the other person’s traits, you might notice some good attributes that you haven’t noticed before.\\n3. Specific appreciation.\\nThis step works wonders because now you get the chance to show the reader how much you care and notice about him or her. Describing deeply why you’re thankful for what they’ve been doing is an excellent way to strengthen bonds between you two.\\nWe know that perfect relationships are an illusion and we should never set unrealistic expectations for ourselves nor for others. Instead, try to look at relationship building as a journey and learning process and you’ll be able to handle it smoothly. =)\\nHope it helps!', 'upvote': 0, 'view': 35, 'date': 'Apr 10, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': ['Content Writing', 'Creative Writing', 'Relationships', 'Writing Advice', 'Writing', 'Self-Improvement', 'Relationship Advice', 'Dating and Relationships', 'Interpersonal Interaction', 'Life Advice']}\n",

I think in times like this, especially if either one of your main love languages is Touch, then it is key to try to top up your 2nd love language in whatever way you can. People feel loved in different ways, and not hitting the right one feels just like buying a washing machine for your wife on v-day (okay, not the best of example cause some would really love that, but you get the idea).\\nKnow that love is a choice, not a feeling. - You’d be surprise but yes, love is not a feeling. Ask any married couple who have been together for years and they will tell you that there are many times when they felt irritated by their partners, etc, but it’s the choice to love regardless. Feelings do make it easier, but the key essence is still a choice. There is this joke I’ve heard, “A boyfriend is someone who irritates you 90% of the time, but also loves you 10% of the time in a way that makes you forget that 90%.”\\nLove is also spelt T-I-M-E. - Take time to invest in each other’s lives, whether be it to FaceTime each other, or just have a morning / goodnight call here and there. If you both have decided to choose each other, then make the effort to be there for each other (even if it has to be over video rather than in person). Just like a child who will eventually grow closer to the parent who invested more time in their life, the same applies to our partners.\\nConsistency over intensity. - We have always favoured intensity over consistency. Just like how we wait till the end of the season to binge watch a TV show over the weekend; or we do crash diets and hope that it will be successful. However, what really works and lasts is consistency, never intensity. Working out 14 hours at one go is never going to work as well as 30 mins a day over a month. Going to the dentist once every 6 months is never going to be as effective as that 3 mins of brushing your teeth twice daily. The same goes with your relationship. It wasn’t because you pursued your partner over the weekend (or the other way round if you are on the receiving end) constantly that got you both together. It’s all the little things that you both did for or together (e.g. you saw a movie and wanted to watch it together; he/she wanted to get some groceries and got something for you; etc) that made both of you realise one day that, “Hey, I love this person.”\\nI know that it all seems like a lot of things to remember or even do, and this might be a monkey wrench into what I shared but… know that there is no formulae to relationships. What works for one, doesn’t necessarily mean it will work for another. I’m just sharing from a very broad perspective the key points in which I think will point you in the right direction to exploring what works for yours. You don’t need to take all. If only one resonates with you, take that one and run with it. You can add / remove any of the points as you progress with your lives. There isn’t a right or wrong way to do relationships.\\nWith that, I wish both of you all the best during these difficult times.', 'upvote': 2, 'view': 51, 'date': 'error'}}, 'topic_list': ['Healthy Relationships', 'Relationships', 'Dating Advice', 'Dating and Relationships', 'Survey Question']}\n",

I am aware this must come as a severe blow to many preconceived generational prejudices, but:\\nMillennial’s are human beings. Millennial’s are multi-lingual, and can converse in the King’s English intelligently, coherently, and with a decent vocabulary.\\nMillennial’s have hopes and dreams, just as with any other generation. And, Millennial’s have worries, fears, and grave concerns, that would do justice to any person of any other generation.\\nMy friend, I hate labels.. I despise labels. I refuse to “paint with the wide brushstrokes of glittering generalities” any person, or any group of people, regardless of demographic.\\nPeople are people are people are people!\\nIt’s high time for this segregationist, isolationist, and comparative world to “get off their frigging high horse”, and simply accept people as people.\\nI am a retired truck driver. Just that one sentence is so damned limiting. Every preconceived notion people have about truck drivers falls neatly into a prejudiced little box, with or without the pretty bow on top.\\nJust that one “classification” eliminates any possibility this truck driver is university educated, loves the poetry of T.S. Eliot, and listens to the music of Bach, Telemann, Albinoni, Corelli, and Vivaldi. And, on stressful days, I relax listening to Gregorian Chant.\\nI drove truck to pay the frigging bills. But, I am not a truck driver. I am a human being. And, so is every person on the face of God’s Little Green Earth.\\nMillennial’s are delightful young people. The only difference between a Millennial and myself is the accidental accumulation of age. Neither is it the fault of any Millennial in which year they were born.\\nMillennial’s would appreciate being treated with the same dignity and respect owed to all people, for the simple reason they are human beings!

If the injury is minor and the partner sincerely apologizes and pledges to not do it again, go ahead and carry on with the new improved relationship. If the injury was serious (cheating for example) and the apology and repentance are not sincere, carrying on as before would not be forgiveness—it would be stupidity. If the injury is severe, and the apology and repentance are sincere, it may still take quite a long time to heal the relationship. The relationship certainly can’t go back to the way it was. In that case the relationship can only go forward in a healthy way if the relationship is transformed by serious efforts by the partners to transform their lives and their relationship.

This is a classic sign of emotional abuse. If you want to go out with your friends but they insist you stay at home, they should be okay with it if you decide to leave. Guilt tripping is a form of manipulation because they want to make you act in a certain way without flat out telling you what to do.\\n.

Why? The reason is because being habituated to a stress response-the fight/flight/freeze response of that automatic brain- contributes greatly to our inability to access contentment and to be open and close with others and NeurOptimal works with that brainwave habit.\\nLet me explain in greater detail. NeurOptimal neurofeedback software reads and is responsive in real time to the trainee’s brainwaves. It gives feedback through auditory cues when it wants that automatic functioning brain to pay attention to what it’s doing habitually.\\nStress is a brain habit of assuming there is danger present when there is none. If there IS imminent danger then, yes, we want our brain to go on auto-pilot and punch, run or play dead to keep us alive. (That is the brain’s definition of danger: occurring NOW and life-threatening.)\\nWhen not perceiving present danger, the brain is supposed to be in a state of regulation: calm, able to focus, feel peaceful, playful, responsive to present in an accurate way, breathing normally, sleeping when tired.\\nWe know stress as not sleeping well, worrying too much, having a hard time feeling joy and resistance to wanting to open up to others.\\nIn my 9 years of working with people using NeurOptimal there are two factors that contribute the most to success shifting out of stress.\\nReadiness to be a different person. Wanting to change; being ready for change. People who walk into my office for neurofeedback and say, “I’m ready to be less worried.” “I’m tired of being alone.” “I’m ready to feel joy again.” My guess as to why that is an important factor is because their thoughts won’t work against the reset will organically unfold as the brain sees its habits. As they calm down and cheer up, the mind response will be, “yes!” rather than, “Is this OK, my worry is my safety net. I can’t let that go.”\\nSeeing optimization or a positive reset of themselves as a holistic endeavor rather than a “one-pill-wonder” approach. To reset out of our habitual patterns and help our brains rewire, and our mood improve, we need to employ many tools, not just one. In doing so, we create the overall environment supportive for health and well-being. Here are three key ones to have alongside neurofeedback training:\\nEnough sleep. Stress also impacts quality of sleep so just starting your NeurOptimal with a good sleep hygiene routine is a good start. Give yourself 3 months to reset your sleep with the goal of 7–8 hours a night. The brain eliminates toxins at night while we sleep. Here’s a more in-depth blog and free sleep hygiene e-book I created.\\nExercise. So important for helping the body and brain reset. 3–5 times a week, start with what’s doable and work up to it.\\nEating a brain foods rich diet. Your brain needs the building blocks to improve itself. That includes foods high in omega-3s, and reducing foods that cause inflammation such as sugar, which messes with our guts, which is where important brain neurotransmitters (our happy chemicals) are made.', 'upvote': 2, 'view': 120, 'date': 'Apr 6, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': ['Neurofeedback', 'Relationships', 'Developing and Maintaining Happiness', 'Happiness', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Advice', 'Dating and Relationships', 'Interpersonal Interaction']}\n",

They appeared to have a happy marriage and due to Sarah’s bubbly personality they seemed to be a fun couple. They had two daughters together, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Andrew’s absences took a toll on Sarah and she was a constant victim of the gossip tabloid press much the same as Meghan, Duchess of Sussex is today. The couple separated in March of 1992. There were hopes that they would reconcile, but photos of Sarah, who was always called “Fergie,” surfaced in the tabloids in intimate association with John Bryan, her financial advisor at the time, thus killing any idea of a reconciliation and the couple divorced on May 30, 1996.\\nThe couple shared custody of their two daughters and continued to share the family home, Sunninghill Park,\\nSunninghill Park - Wikipedia In 2004 Prince Andrew moved to his present home, Royal Lodge. Royal Lodge - Wikipedia. Sarah purchased a home beside Royal lodge called Dolphin House in 2007. In 2008 a fire destroyed Dolphin House and she moved into Royal Lodge with Andrew and their daughters. They seem to have built a comfortable life together, though they have not remarried. Royal Lodge is big enough for each of them to have their own space when needed, but they still work together as a couple when convenient and visit the Queen at Balmoral together in the summer the week before Prince Philip arrives. He has an aversion to Fergie and out of respect she leaves before Philip arrives.', 'upvote': 216, 'view': 94400.0, 'date': 'Apr 11, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

In short the answer is there is a tremendous amount of selfish and self-centered behavior that results form addiction. How to get it. How to not run out. How to hold withdrawal at bay.\\nThese are all very time consuming endeavors. It leaves little time for concern for others. That isn’t to imply addicts don’t love others - they do! And, when they promise to discontinue use because the harm that they are doing others is genuine and sincere, in the moment it is made. But that moment is short lived because of the compulsion to return to using.\\nFor the spouse or relation of an addict they are left confused by promises and repeated conversations that result in a return to using only shortly after extracting those promises.\\nBecause true love and commitment to another as in a marriage requires a tremendous amount of compromise and consideration of the other persons needs, this makes the addict/alcoholic while in active use a poor selection for that type of relationship. In order to have a successful marriage/relationship you’d have to have the ability to put the other persons needs before your own “on occasion”. Without the ability to do this the other partner is often left feeling like they are always making concessions, excuses and ultimately capitulation to the other person and their disease of addiction. It results in anger, resentment, passive aggressive or outright aggressive behavior which eminmates from an extreme sense of frustration and helplessness.\\nThere are programs such as Al-Anon or Nar-Anon, counseling, community resources etc. to assist the spouse/partner of an addict. These are advisable. The partner of an addict/alcoholic might often wonder why “they” need assistance or a program if the “other” person is the one with the problem. The challenge here is that addiction is insidious, an all encompassing. It has the power to swallow a family whole and keep going. To the co-sufferer of someone with addiction, you’ll know that last statement is not hyperbole. Therefore if the addict is incapable of admitting there’s a problem and seeking assistance, it’s good for someone/anyone in the family to acknowledge the problem is likely larger than extracting a true promise of abstinence/reduction from the afflicted and seek outside help.\\nAt these programs the spouse/partner of an addict will learn what things, comments, actions that they may be taking that aren’t only not helpful but may be exacerbating the circumstances. They learn about how actions, sometimes referred to as “enabling” are actually prolonging the addiction. This is done with an inadvertent misunderstanding of addiction and how powerful it is.\\nI wish you and your family all the hope of finding a solution to a family problem.

An answer that can’t be proved right or wrong, so all I have to offer is my opinion.\\nNo, I don’t believe it is. Capitalism was never designed to be a scheme to protect health for once-in-a-century problems that only now with global air travel is much more likely to occur more often. The seeds of capitalism were growing long before airplanes were created. In fact, airplane technology is a result of capitalism, so the current global travel environment is also an offshoot of capitalism.\\nThe method that most of society has been using to deal with problems of this nature was to put in place a team of experts on health and epidemiologists. The WHO (World Health Organization) is performing an adequate job for most of the world’s coordination in this issue. In the USA (where I am familiar with), we have the CDC, which can call on the help of FEMA, the US military, and other national organizations to provide assistance.\\nWe have had a special White House team that coordinated with 40+ international offices that kept a lookout all over the globe for such problems. These experts developed detailed plans to handle as best as they could predict what was needed to be done quickly to fend off the next viral epidemic.\\nSadly, Americans were conned into electing a president that knew nothing about science, management, or government, and had no interest in learning anything about these matters. Several years ago most of these offices were de-funded and closed out of ignorance. So the USA had no plan in place, no agency to handle the early warning signs, and no effective leadership. Combined with a refusal to do what needs to be done, our president had even to this day April 10, 2020, failed to place an experienced leader to handle this crisis.\\nIf the country that could land a man on the moon could not manage this problem, it seems natural that less developed, less wealthy countries had as much of a chance to effectively manage this crisis. Some have minimized the problem very well (North Korea, Germany, and even China to some degree), most haven’t. I suspect it’s because most countries have leadership that is as incompetent as the USA has in handling difficult problems.\\nSo the clear answer was that the current crisis in the USA and many other countries is and was a failure of government leadership in ways too numerous to mention. Capitalism is not to blame, it was not created for this type of crisis. Government is to blame, because the last administration was put in place only 3 years ago with the understanding that it would manage such a crisis.', 'upvote': 1, 'view': 85, 'date': 'Apr 11, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': ['Relationships', 'COVID-19 (2019-2020)']}\n",

You become irreplaceable once you’ve shown what you 2 are together. And to do that, Trust & Respect is what I believe are the key factors for it.\\nTrust is not just a mere word. It has a deep and an important meaning to everything you do in a relationship. Any relation can’t work efficiently if it lacks trust. Relationships are about exposing yourself to risks that other people can impose on.\\nFor example: When you get into a Uber, you trust your cab driver to get you to the destination and to only cheat you a little bit.\\nYou trust the worker behind the Glass-window on Subway, not to spit in your sandwich..\\nTrust is fundamental to our existence. We are social creatures and trust solidifies the bond between each of us. If you don’t enrich your relationship with trust, then how can you be successful?\\nRespect, it’s a combination of appreciation, admiration and recognition of a person, being worth something for the other. As someone else said “If you don’t have it, it will be like driving a car up the hill slope with a giant magnet forcing you back to your commencement.”\\nIt’s about seeing someones pro’s and con’s, flaws and strengths, and still feeling appreciation of their unique talents, gifts and insights.\\nIt is not about expecting perfection not is it beating someone into submission. Just respect your partner for who he/she is.\\nWhen you take a moment to think about treating your partner with respect, remember the issues and challenges you’ll be able to solve together if you both accept each other. Remember on how happy a relationship would be if you can be yourself, showing your unique, bad and good sides.\\nOn the end note; Wanting to fulfill your partner and becoming irreplaceable is something we all strive for, wether you believe it or not, but being irreplaceable is nothing without a strong relationship. Trust & Respect is the glue that can grow lasting, connected and deeply intimate relationships. Never take it for granted.\\nWish you all luck!', 'upvote': 1, 'view': 109, 'date': 'Apr 3, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

The type that post more suggestive content rather than fitness content.', 'answer_count': 1, 'create_time': 'Apr 12, 2020', 'question_author': 'Sam Calderon', 'no_of_follower': 1, 'no_of_view': '1,171', 'respond': {'0': {'user_name': 'Hailey Harber', 'answer': \"You mean, ‘fitness models’ like me?\\nI don’t bat an eyelash if my husband decides to follow another chick. I know he’s mine and he knows I’m his. Trust plays a huge factor in this, and this is something I’ve seen many ladies especially (not always, but normally it’s the gals) get upset about. Of course I would imagine that the wife or girlfriend looks at the Insta model and immediately feels threatened, and/or thinks her man is getting off to her pics or sexually fantasizing about her.\\nIt may seem kinda weird, and I’m sure I’m gonna get the, “It’s because you’re a female!” response, but I deal with many, MANY jacked, ripped dudes on a daily basis (not that my hubby isn’t one sexy jacked mofo ;) ), but I have NEVER thought anything more about ANY of them other than, “Dude, you’ve worked your ass off and you look great. Fucking congrats man.” There’s no sexual fantasy, no further mind play. IMO there’s a huge difference in being able to admire someone’s physique, and sexually fantasizing about them. I’m not sure what your personal reasons are for wanting to follow these ladies, but if you find yourself with more sexual thoughts than thoughts of general ‘damn she is hot, how can a body be so nice, wow she’s worked her ass off,’ then maybe you need to sit and re-evaluate a few things, especially if you’re in a committed relationship with a gal who you KNOW would be put-off by the simple act of you following this other gal.\\nHowever it really depends on the couple. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve sent my husband a photo of some other insta model’s boobs/body and been like, “Dude, THAT is nice.” (I’m 100% straight, just in case you were also wondering). It’s often that I’m showing HIM photos of other chicks that I think are just gorgeous. I very much appreciate the beauty of the physique and often look at photos of others in near nude garb, and there’s never an inkling of a sexual thought. But I also do realize that my marriage might be a bit of a rarity for a few reasons- first is that I’ve busted me ASS to attain a sexy physique. I KNOW I look good (please spare the comments- I’m not everyone’s cup of tea, nor do I pretend to be, and that’s fine. But I knew what I wanted and I have worked for the last 7 years to try to make it a reality). My confidence is probably higher than the average. Couple that with the fact that I TRUST MY HUSBAND WITH MY LIFE, and boom — instant recipe for ‘Hey babe check out this chicks boobs!’ (Not trying to be vulgar- that REALLY happens here in this house! Lol). Don’t really need to say more about that. But if these factors are lacking, then issues in the relationship may arise, and I would speculate that they would revolve primarily around both insecurity and trust (or lack of trust).\\nSome individuals are just wired in a way that would never allow for them to be comfortable with it. I have a friend who has flat out told me, “Hailey, I just could never do what you do, no offense, and I couldn’t imagine ever being okay with her (girlfriend) following a bunch of other shirtless dudes” (my friend is a guy). So there really are many factors to consider, and this whole, “Should I follow that sexy Insta model” really is up to what you and your partner deem acceptable. I would definitely suggest bringing it up and discussing it with them. Elaborate as to what your intentions are in following the people that you want to follow, and ask them if they have any issues with it.\\nTHAT IS THE SHORT VERSION. BUT I would like to add some input on my mental progression with confidence and self-esteem issues as the years have progressed and my physique has continued to improve. I will elaborate on both my prior outlook as the insecure girlfriend, as well as my current outlook.\\nAgain, I realize my physique isn’t the cats meow for everyone; I did what I needed to do to attain MY version of the ideal female physique (and I’m still working on it!). It has ALWAYS been about getting to that point where I’m satisfied with my physique (I’m not there and honestly don’t think it will ever come), BUT this question had me stop and rewind time 7 years - back before any of my lifting endeavors. Back when my physique was nothing more than that of the ‘straight up and down’ of a boy’s body. Back when my confidence was buried under the baggy clothes that worked so well to hide the shame I harbored for my body. Of course, 7 years of time has allowed me to grow into a much more mentally secure person (in general), but I can’t deny that I would have felt vulnerable and threatened if my then-boyfriend 7 years ago would have shown me a photo of some curvy, gorgeous Insta model. It’s true. But it’s quite interesting to analyze how I’M now the one showing my husband photos of these other ladies.\\nI’ve never been one who has an easy time holding her tongue. The older I get, the more prone I am to dispensing that stone cold, seemingly heartless line of truth that everyone is thinking but no one else will dare utter. When the idiot spouts off at the mouth, I’m generally the one in the room who will be the first to pipe up. I find this quality exacerbating as the years progress, and I must add that I feel a bit…… bitter towards most. The reasons are quite numerous, honestly, but there’s one I particular reason that is quite fitting for this discussion. Please pardon me, as this is really turning into a lengthy piece.\\nTwo quotes have stuck with me throughout the entirety of my life, and one of them is the following, “There is no such thing as an ugly woman; just a lazy, uninformed one.” Now please, I KNOW my faults, and my imperfections are too numerous to count. I don’t want to give the impression that I’m rooting my own horn, but holy shit have I put in my time. While in college I scouted for and found a job that would allow me to work minimal hours for maximal dough (a high-school sports photography job). Time was a precious resource for me and every extra hour I had was dedicated to reading. Reading and reading and reading and READING. The journal articles, the pubmed studies, the blog posts by the experts in the field - I was OBSESSED, and was often locked away in the room I rented for 300 bucks (bills included ;) ). I knew what I wanted my physique to look like, and I knew that I knew that I had to put in my time in the books to make my time in the gym the most efficient as possible.\\nI was OBSESSED. I knew what I wanted and did what I had to do to make things work. There was no time for the whole pity party of ‘poor me I’m so insecure and self-conscious.’ My schedule included classes and work, but I MADE time. How? I scouted for a job that paid me $100 per hour. I rented a room from a lady for $300 per month, and often cleaned the rest of her home (and her car and her mother’s home) for deductions in my rent. Often times I was paying $150–$200 in rent, with a total of $400-$600 in expenses per month. Of course this meant that my monthly expenses were paid for by working just a measly 4–6 hours a week. I drove a ‘99 Camry so gas was cheap. My only other expense was car insurance. I cut out every other unnecessary expense. Those were the days of using email and facebook to contact people (mooching off free WiFi) since I refused to pay for monthly cell service. My splurging was spending 20 bucks at the local thrift store for a few new shirts, and maybe 5 bucks at a local bakery on Sunday. Sales at the grocery store were my go-to, to the point of even asking if they would just give me their old ‘no good’ throw away veggies (they couldn’t due to legal reasons. I then countered and said I’ll sign any liability waiver… nope 😕 lol). I ate the cactus out of my own backyard to save money. I fucking MADE IT WORK. I MADE time for my schooling, my studies (studies meaning gym-related studies), as well as the actual lifting. It has been a long 7 years, but I have scrapped and scrounged every minute to be able to change my life and attain the things I want most.\\nI used to be that self-conscious girl. Sure, I still have my moments, and there are some things that can’t be changed no matter how much work we invest. BUT there’s a great deal that we CAN do. You DO have the time- you just aren’t hungry enough to MAKE the time. You AREN’T HUNGRY ENOUGH to make it work, and you aren’t willing to do whatever is within your control to change your life- and potentially your outlook.\\nMy experiences have definitely given me a new perspective to this whole ‘self esteem’ issue. I’ve had other trainers comment and tell me that women they’ve worked with have done complete mental 180 (with regards to self-esteem) as they’ve trained into a physique they’re now satisfied with. Many ladies (and men also, of course) are quick to sit back and get upset that some of these models even exist, but they won’t lift one finger to change a thing about themselves or their situation. Many times, their only issue with you looking at photos of other women is their own insecurity. Yet instead of stepping up and trying to better themselves, they'll forever sit in their slump and place restrictions on YOU. Again, there are certainly those individuals who have other issues with the issue of the question asked- issues that have nothing to do with insecurity/self esteem, and that’s understandable. But many, MANY ladies (and men!) are quick to shackle you and forever leave it at that because they’re absolutely unwilling to step up to the plate to try to better themselves.\\nSure, one day I’ll be old and withered — that’s life. But I’ll also be old and withered right next to the individual who I trust with my life and I know will stick with me through anything. I’ll probably miss my tight physique when I’m 90, and will look back at how my glutes were as shapely as they were, how my ab and forearm veins would always make their appearance. I’ll probably be old and sad about the fact that the things I once worked so hard for have withered away in what seemed like a blink of the eye. Hell, I’ll probably even be a little jelly when a gorgeous 30 year old woman saunters by me (BUT I WILL STILL LOOK LOL). But I’ll remember that some things, like getting old, are inevitable. Not a thing can be done about it. Then I’ll also remember that I took it upon myself myself to change what could be changed to better my life when the time allowed for it.\", 'upvote': 6, 'view': 522, 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': ['Following and Followers on Instagram', 'Instagram (company)', 'Relationships', 'Instagram (product)', 'Fitness', 'Social Media', 'Relationship Advice', 'Dating Advice', 'Dating and Relationships']}\n",

Anyway we then went out for dinner w his parents, finally got to his place around midnight. I had to go back to my place so I could be closer to work the next day. So I packed my bags (I had a bunch this weekend) at least 3 duffle bags and like I said it was late… my car was parked in the guest parking lot of the apartment complex he resides in.\\nit’s about at least a 5 min walk and the neighborhood is not safe outside the luxury apartment complex (outsiders can randomly walk into the parking lot)\\nanyway so I cleaned up the kitchen (because I also cooked earlier in the day) and put everything away and waited for him because I guess I assumed he’d offer to walk me to my car? 1. Being it was midnight , 2. Being the neighborhood and 3. So many bags\\nwell he didn’t , he changed n sat on the couch relaxing w his phone …. So I said “with a tone” (as he claims) “aren’t you going to walk me to my car?”\\nhe replies “why do u have to be such a bitch about it? U can kindly say hi babe can u walk me to my car?”\\n(now I really wasn’t a “bitch” I said “aren’t u going to walk me to my car?” I have never cursed at him or yelled or demanded much within our time together because of his ex trauma I am pretty laid back…..) I could have said it nicer but I wasn’t NASTY.\\nI had replied something along the lines of the reasons why I wanted him to walk me to my car to begin with. Anyway he grabbed some bags and fast walked without a word and angrily to my vehicle. I tried to catch up walking fast as well with bags In my arms. It took us more than 5 min to get to the car because it was so late the pathway with shortcut was locked for the night.\\nAnyway he hadn’t spoken to me the whole walk, had an angry attitude and dropped my bags at the car and walked away! I tried to talk to him, he ignored me!!! He never checked if I got home ok , nothing. ( and I almost got stuck on the road because I was supposed to add fuel to my car prior to meeting his parents for dinner but since one thing led to another that didn’t happen but that is not his fault). My point is he wouldn’t have known because he didn’t even care to see what time I got home.\\nThe next day I was to blame from him for speaking in a tone. His sister even yelled at me. (He’s 40, she’s 44 and I’m 36!) she’s like you don’t appreciate anything he does and that was a small thing he didn’t realize blah blah. I think it’s messed up I got attacked for things he does for me because I always appreciated him and his actions and I always told him and showed him in my ways as well. (His sis is bipolar I’m not sure if he is, he never told me but his ex posted an article on “how to deal w a bipolar spouse). Anyway… so\\nNow even if I had a “tone”, isn’t that a little extreme behavior from his end? He claimed afterwards i triggered him because it reminded him of an instance w his ex wife but Like in reality I feel like it didn’t have to be so extreme.\\nJust taking opinions and thoughts. Thank you…\\n(fast forward a few months and he went from exclaiming his love for me one evening to never speaking to me again 8 hours later. He had broken up w me via text. His sister got involved within those hours and yelled at me again)\\nI never received any closure he never let me see or speak to him, I was blocked on any way to reach out to him. All this from someone who just told me how much he’s in love with me and how he wants to marry me…(still don’t know which part of the divorce process he’s in, but doesn’t matter anymore). I just would like some feedback about the above scenario to anyone that is still reading. Being part of his life for a year and being in his apartment 4/7 days a week and being part of his life to being kicked out like trash without a clue is really a horrible thing to go through emotionally. I understand no one is perfect but I have been through his side no matter what all year and dealt with a lot of his anger from his ex relationship (I mean Examples of just asking him a question have led to him yelling and cursing at me bad words and claiming I’m jealous like his ex, which in fact the question was not even about jealousy or drama related) that’s why I feel like even if I did have a tone this was uncalled for?

It attacks and ruthlessly kills human beings of all types and all walks of life: young and old, all races and all ethnicity, all religions and spiritual affiliations, all genders and all social and economic status.\\nAs a spiritual counselor, I believe that the following will transpire:\\nWe will begin to take our relationships and our connections we have with people in general - especially with our loved ones - much more seriously. We won’t take for granted our connections any longer. We will treat, behave and speak to our connections as though we are no longer promised another tomorrow.\\nWe will live our lives more mindfully. We will learn to fully embrace our feelings in general. We will experience joy and pleasure with new eyes. We will experience loss and grief with new eyes. We will taste our food completely. We will feel each sensation and emotion and we will savor.\\nThis disease may very well lead the masses to a new mindset regarding tolerance. We live in an extremely diverse yet very intolerant world. Yet when one cannot breathe, we are all alike. We are all the same. We are all human beings. We may become more empathetic as a society.\\nWe will learn to appreciate our senses. Touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing. Each experience we have will have meaning and won’t be taken for granted.\\nWe will learn to connect with G-d in a deeper, more meaningful way. We will, as a society, come to realize that each day and each experience we have - however briefly - is actually a gift. We will learn simple gratitude.\\nWe as a society will realize that the “almighty dollar” isn’t important. Not really. Not when you cannot breathe. As a result, we will learn to share and to give. To treat others as we’d hope to be treated.\\nFor example, I found a list of some 300 EPA approved COVID-19 cleaning products. Most are NOT Clorox or Lysol, although they’re on the list too. Some are very much still available at regular prices. I searched the list and we actually had some of those products already in the house. I think most people probably will so there’s no reason to pay crazy prices for Lysol. (I would link it here but there’s a rule about adding links so if you just do a basic internet search for the list, you’ll find it, it’s very easy to find.) It’s a public service list or something. Anyway, but I see eBay listings for ONE can of Lysol for $45,000! People believe that’s the only way they will live. How cruel and sad is that? I have cleaning products and know where to buy them but why should I be the only one who lives? What’s that passage about the meek? That’s why I posted the list instead of buying up all the products then trying to sell them. It’s my take that people will realize that it’s WRONG to try to profit from a pandemic and the pain that others experience and PEOPLE WILL DEVELOP EMPATHY.\\nI believe this world will develop empathy as a result of this pandemic. Because as I said before, if you owned something that would save a life would you not share it? Hopefully, you would! That is why I share. I definitely don’t want to end up going to judgement and G-d saying, “hope that $45,000 was worth your soul.” Just saying. I think people will learn to treat others with respect. Dignity. And unconditional love and with empathy from this point forward.\\nBlessings xo', 'upvote': 1, 'view': 178, 'date': 'Apr 7, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

If you think someone else drinks too much, you may be right, but even if you’re married to them, if they don’t think it’s a problem, it becomes your problem.\\nI know that’s a wishy-washy answer. Ownership of the problem is the problem. You’re scratching the surface of a world of frustration.\\nAt the point where a person loses important things (like jobs and relationships) and lies to you, they are most likely still at a fork in the road. The more stubborn they are, the more “normal” the behavior feels to them, so it’s hard to argue.\\nEventually logic gets thrown away.\\nThough your described subject may not be there yet, when someone plays by no rules, you can’t win. Unfortunately their posture is also that they’ve already lost, which is why they will continue to act desperately.\\nTo call drinking a problem is, for as long as the alcohol-user can sustain, a matter of opinion. Alcoholism is self-diagnosed. You could benefit from talking with knowledgeable people personally about your situation.\\nBest of luck.

Falling in love is easy to do, almost effortless, but losing that loving feeling is not that hard to do, either.\\nOf course, when a relationship is new, it is fun and enjoyable courting or being courted. In the beginning, we are constantly thinking about the new person in our life, and wanting to spend all of our time together and share new experiences together. We want to show how we feel by getting cards or flowers or just sending a cute text message.\\nFeelings, however, can be fleeting. No one seems to want to talk about how those loving feelings can fade, that it takes work to keep the love alive, and that choosing to stay in love is a choice we all must make.Who we love is as much of a choice as it is a feeling. Staying in love takes a commitment. After the rosy glow of the new relationship wears off, we have to make a decision: Do we want to love this person and commit to a relationship together, or are we going to let this person go? Once we have made the decision that we have found the person we want to be with and commit to, then the work begins.\\nA big part of that work is making many other choices. It is a choice to see the good in our partner every day, rather than focusing on the negative things that bother us. We have to accept them and love them as they are. If we go into a relationship thinking we can change someone, we are setting our relationship and ourselves up to fail. We all have flaws and quirks and are weird in some ways. Accepting those differences is part of love. We can choose to ignore the petty, irritating small things our partner may do. If our partner forgets to take out the garbage, or leaves the cap off the toothpaste, we can talk about it with them, but we also can accept that this just might be forgetful, and choose to move on.\\nTrying to change our partner into us is one of the biggest relationship mistakes we can make. When we are unhappy with how things are in our relationship, it is easy to overfocus on what we are not getting from the relationship. Instead, a healthier response is to see what we could be doing for our partner, rather than focusing on what they are not doing for us. We should always try to be supportive of our partner, because we cannot expect anything from our partner that we are not willing to give ourselves.\\nAnother important choice we can make is to choose to remember the reasons why we committed to this person. Our relationship will not always be pleasant and there will be times for serious discussions and disagreement. There will be trying times and even bad times that we will need to work through together. The key to surviving these times is to remember to be respectful, acknowledge our commitment, and work through whatever is at hand together. During these times it really helps to remind ourselves of why we chose to love them in the first place.\\nLove is all about choices. We choose to see the good, ignore the petty, look for what we could do for our partner, and remember why we love our partner.

I may be bit selfish in here or completely selfish I would say, but u see this process allows my mind to stay calm! If I don't spend much time chit chatting I certainly am left with so much time for myself where I can think of stuffs I wana achieve, analyse my relationships around, think about how I wana help my parents, watch movies, read books!! Lately I have realised that I am a good catch at expressing stuffs so I have started to write on QUORA! This doesn't mean I leave the chats all the time, I just ignore the unimportant ones! People close to me have surely felt my ignorance a alot of time but still have stood by my side and that's because I be there when needed, I be there when no one is, I be there when the hope is lost and the heart is broken!\\nI be there not immediately but definitely!\\nA big shoutout to my friends for bearing with my stupid attitude, I love you guys!\\nKajal & Simran being the primary victims, hence I love u guys more!❤️\", 'upvote': 0, 'view': 23, 'date': 'Apr 16, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': ['Conversations', 'Relationships', 'Friendship Advice', 'Social Advice', 'Friendship', 'Relationship Advice', 'Dating Advice', 'Dating and Relationships', 'Interpersonal Interaction', 'Survey Question']}\n",

You are not faking up you are showing your inner feelings to your partner for what you feel about themselves and more you share to each other more the relationship grows and you can also become better person.\\nIt will remove the pressure of relationship from your mind like you both can answer without hesitation to anyone if someone ask about you both .\\nThis step is a bit negative and that is break up is easy because no one knows about you except you and when relationship is secret you don't need to say to anyone how much you love,feel for him/her or what did he/she did for me on my birthday etc….\\nYou can be who you are with your best friend, because sometimes some people think that if I will be in relationship than I won't be able to talk like before with my best friend and all its a total crap but if relationship is secret u can be yourself.\\nDISADVANTAGES\\nMost people keep secret about their relationship is because they have a fear of being judged or their loved ones would not accept their relationship. This happens a lot when you have a relationship with a person of other caste or religion generally your family won’t support it. And this fear force people to keep their relationship secret and this creates more disputes. If the people who really love you and understand you then you should not hide about your relationship\\nIf you are planning to keep this secret for some time and then open to everyone then this kind of relationship would have a Chance of getting damage.\\nAnd don't upload lots of photos on any social networking sites because by seeing this anyone can doubt on your relationship and avoid going to places where your mutual friends go and the most smartest way is to keep on changing the name of that person in our contact list .\\nI know I wrote so much because I love to write about relationship stuff and all and now last thing is:\\nIf you want to be together for a lifetime than it could be good for you sometimes to keep your secret, it completely depends on you.\\nI hope this will help you and I gave your answer accurately.\", 'upvote': 0, 'view': 72, 'date': 'Apr 8, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

But the main advice is, you have to disentangle yourself from this toxic person. It’s going to hurt, but it’s going to hurt a lot more if you keep her in your life.\\nFirst, the legal problems. Was the marriage legally recognized, by a marriage certificate or equivalent? The law doesn’t care if the marriage was secret or not. If you do have a legally valid marriage, you should legally divorce, because otherwise you are still entangled with this person. Depending on local laws, you might not be able to date other people without being accused of adultery, which means you might end up having to pay your ex a lot of money. So, I’d start there. If it wasn’t a legally-recognized marriage (but was recognized by the Hindu faith as being valid), then I’m not sure what you have to do, as I don’t know what the rules are concerning divorce in that faith.\\nSecond, interpersonal: basically, you should break off contact, and look for somebody else (after taking care of any legal/cultural prohibitions against seeing someone else). Getting dumped really sucks, I’ve been there. But there are other people out there. You just have to move on.\\nThird, cultural: are other people going to look down on you because you are in this situation? Here I’m not so sure what to say, because I admit I’m not really familiar with your culture. But I will say, if you think that you have an accurate analysis of the situation, trust that analysis, even if you are being pressured to see things differently. Again, hard to do, but you have to trust the fact that your family, friends, or priest will not be in possession of as many facts as you are. They won’t know what that relationship was really like. So basically, trust yourself.\\nGood luck, I’m rooting for you.', 'upvote': 3, 'view': 109, 'date': 'Jan 30, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': ['Moving On', 'Advice About Love', 'Relationships', 'Ex-Boyfriend and Ex-Girlfriend Advice', 'Breaking Up', 'Ex-Boyfriends and Ex-Girlfriends', 'Love Life Advice', 'Marriage', 'Love', 'Relationship Advice', 'Dating Advice', 'Dating and Relationships']}\n",

Last night, I met with 6 friends on the basic ZOOM for about 45 minutes - we drank wine in our respective houses, discussed movies and shows that were binge-worthy. One person talked about how they made one thing a day to look forward to. My husband had been sliding towards depression, and he laughed a lot for the first time in awhile.\\nI think that’s the answer: use what you have to keep that flame burning. Schedule skyping sessions, zooming times with groups of friends you have in common, or those that you planned to introduce him to. We scheduled dinner/lunch with my daughter who lives in England - we’d hoped to visit her fairly soon but that’s off. They ate dinner while we ate lunch, and it was good! I got to know her husband’s sister a bit more - she’s shy and quiet, so it’ll take awhile. I got to see them as a family, which made me feel good about how they’re doing, and I’d been worried, deep down, in the pit of my stomach. I have faith in her, really, but it’s a mom thing. You worry. It comes with the territory.\\nSo, tl:dr… Use the good side of social networking to build that foundation, and not just one on one, but with all of your friends, your family, and your special person. Make it a point, a focus, go through the hassle, the emailing, the reminding. Clean off the table. Light some candles. Pour the wine, or the good seltzer and fancy juice combo. Comb your hair. Change your shirt. Take a little pride in your appearance for that hour or so. S/he/they are worth it. Show that to them. You’ll make it ok. Really.

You wouldn't even notice a change on the outside, but I'm honestly so stressed I can't even manage simple tasks. People call me lazy when in reality I'm just overwhelmed.”\\n“I get nervous about everything. Sometimes I literally don't know why I'm anxious. I just am, and nobody seems to understand that. “\\n“Anxiety happens when you think you have to figure out everything at once. Breathe. You're strong. You got this. Take it day by day.”\\n“Feeling anxious? Be mindful of where your thoughts are going. Stop replaying troubling memories from the past. Stop obsessing about the future. Breathe. Be present. Then think of one thought or habit you can do to feel better right here in this moment.”\\n“Today I will not stress over things I cannot control.”\\n“When you're feeling anxious, remember that you're still you. You are not your anxiety. “\\n“You wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.”\\n“I hold onto the Scripture that says, “Be anxious for nothing, but in all things give thanks.” I'm not saying I don't have problems or that I don't worry, but I try not to be stressed. I manage my anxiety through prayer. Worry shows up on your face, and I don't want that.”\\n“You are strong for getting out of bed in the morning when it feels like hell. You are brave for doing things even though they scare you and make you anxious. And you are amazing for trying and holding on no matter how hard life gets.”\\n“Anxiety makes you worry about tomorrow, but really all you can control is right now.”\\n“The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another. “\\n“Do not believe the things you tell yourself when you are sad and alone.”\\n“You're not going to master the rest of your life in one day. Just relax. Master the day. Then keep doing that every day.”\\n“You might feel anxious right now, but that means you're still alive and kicking.”\\n“Anxiety is one little tree in your forest.

They become familiar with the other person’s strengths and weaknesses and insecurities that they know all the tricks and games the other person plays.

One can have respect for the other person if the other person has qualities that far outweigh the negatives, but more often than not the negatives set the standard of how one judges the other person.

Sad, but unfortunate, I believe people have no alternative but to finally acknowledge and deal with the fact that they are with a narc.\\nAs predictable as a narc is with their behavior and treatment of others, it is easy to ignore and make excuses for them, when you are not around them as much. Schools are closed, workers are at home, children cannot attend daycare, no restaurants, no bar scene, stay-at-home orders, hence, the days become very long, when one cannot move around from place to place. This movement is a necessity for a narc to get supply and feed their never-ending self-indulgences. When the world is forced to stop and remain in one place, this is extremely stressful for the narc. Narcs need variety and constant supply - from the waiter to the gas station attendant to their partner - in order to ensure they are recognized, adored and worthy. When the narc’s supply is limited or depleted, they cannot handle this. They have very low self-esteem and a very low opinion of themselves, that’s why they wear a mask and mirror their primary supply.\\nWith limited interactions, the narc cannot successfully and continually wear their masks and it begins to slip off. As the mask slips, the true character of the narc begins to show. Compare the narc’s behavior to a feral animal. As long as the animal can find food, shelter and wander freely, it is fine. Put the animal in a box and it becomes uncontrollable and irate. The narc, in essence, is in a box (stay-at-home order). Now the narc must adhere to a boundary or a rule.\\nNow look at the audience (spouse, kids for example), they are forced to share the same environment with the narc during this time. The shared space will quickly become unbearable because the narc has no tolerance for boundaries. The audience is now forced to deal with the narc’s behavior, whereas before, they didn’t have to since the narc had the freedom to wander round. The mask has slipped and the only thing the audience can do is deal with the unbearable situation as best as they can.', 'upvote': 3, 'view': 48, 'date': 'Apr 2, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

Period. For example:\\nYou start to wish good morning to her. But you never done that before.\\nTry to make time for her even if she didn’t ask or asking. If you can’t, SAY SORRY. because SORRY is a word where people put down their ego when they hear it and if she did some mistake or emotional issue in future,she will be the first one ask for forgiveness too.\\nIf problem arise (and all couple used to fight a lot in relationship right). Usually each of you will put some distance or ignore your partner. Now how about keep silence for a while and if you feel calm, hug her. No need to say sorry. Whisper to her ‘I love you’. problem settled easily than before.\\nHave quality time together. It’s not involve a lot of money. Buy a tent from online shop and stay in the tent in one night together. Can set up in front of your house or suitable place. Recall back all the sweet memories especially first met or first date when being in the comforter, facing each other.\\nYou have your own mood right?

It is like when a girl flirt with a cop to get out of a traffic ticket. But a lot of girls confuse romance to be love. Most abusers use that to their advantage first use the romance to draw her in and then feed to her insecurity of not able to find a new man\\nConfuse dating to be same as marriage: Most people Date for marriage. But Dating isn’t marriage. Due to most people Date for marriage, in the west we are seen people confuse Dating to be same as marriage. Dating and marriage are 2 completely different things. Marriage is 2 people becoming Life Partner, Sexual Mate and a Couple till divorce. As for Dating. Dating for marriage is 2 people socialize a bit with romantic intent, to determine whether they want to be together. If the answer is yes, they become a Couple, if the answer is no, they separate. Dating for fun, is 2 people sexually interest in each other, start hanging out a bit. After a period of time, one of two things would happen, (A) They like each other so much and felt they are compatible and become a Couple, this is what is usually refer to as “casual relationship turn serious” or (B) after having a bit of fun, the relationship end. But sometime it doesn’t end on good term. This usually happen when, one party confuse Dating to be same as marriage. So, for example when both party know it is a casual thing, it is unlikely a girl would complain about a guy dumping her after the sex and likely the guy won’t care too much about the girl dating another guy, without telling him. If one party is dating for fun and other is dating for marriage, it depends. If the party dating for marriage, isn’t the type that confuse dating to be same as marriage, this is less likely to be the problem and the girl most likely won’t sleep with the guy, till they are a Couple and guy probably won’t care too much about her dating other guys, he probably be seen other girls also. (But that is providing if both parties are reasonable people) and then there are those that confuse dating to be same as marriage, this is where we start seen girls saying “he is treating a woman like crap for dumping him after the sex” and guys accusing their girlfriend of Cheating, for seen other guys. Because, none of those things are OK, within a Spouse relationship. And if 2 people has become a Couple, dumping a girl after the sex, that is simply not cool. Usually in abusive relationship, the abuser want the relationship to move forward and become serious, exclusive and committed very quickly, due to it help to entrap the girl within a commitment. Most abuser, got very little to loose due to such commitment, because most abusers are narcissist beta male thugs. Narcissist got strong desire for admiration, if he is an alpha male he be the type of boyfriend that sleep with all your friends. But if he is a beta male, he can’t get girls, but as a thug, he care not who he hurt getting what he wants. So, that is where most abusive relationship start, a narcissist beta male thug, trying to entrap a woman to be his trophy to fulfill his narcissist ego, with no regards to how he hurt her.', 'upvote': 1, 'view': 40, 'date': 'Apr 11, 2020'}, '2': {'user_name': 'Marina Pekic', 'answer': \"Ok this is going to sound cruel.

The reason for this statement that both me and my friend have had experience in distance relationship. Not with each other, but with different people.\\nWhile I had to struggle daily to keep the moods up, and that was because the lady and i had never spent sufficient time together, My friend dated my classmate since college, and they're due to get married this year. Or i think they're married already, I'll have to confirm.\\nWhat happened in my case: I had hardly spent any time with my partner as she left for medical college in abroad. The only awkward thing that kept our desperation going, was the conversation between us. Later it didn't work out for us because my work was impacted and our families didn't support our relationship etc.\\nMy friend had ample time to spend with her lady. Her families supported them and they could withstand the long distance relationship, for over 5 years (the guy is in usa and the lady is in india). This could happen because they had spent some time already and this i believe helped them to get through the distance constraint.\\nI was a non believer that long distance relationship works. But after seeing my idiot friend and his fair lady, i am thinking that they did it right. I used to ask my fried whether he had any affairs during all this time. He said it never happened to him. So therefore, the qualities you have in a person matters too. Personally, i never tried to look for an affair until much later in my long distance relationship. The reason for that could be that I was more unhappy and desparate about my long-distance relationship rather than being happy about it (there was nothing to feel happy about, i had to struggle daily just to keep someone happy on a different time zone, Obviously it couldn't have lasted for long..) So, do it right and make it a point to spend time with each other (physical presence, not digital) whenever the distancing gets to you and makes you feel insecure.\\nI wish you luck, friend. The good one. Not the bad one.\", 'upvote': 0, 'view': 46, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': ['Long-Distance Relationship Advice', 'Long-Distance Relationships', 'Love and Relationship Advice', 'Communication', 'Relationships', 'Dating and Relationship Advice', 'Love', 'Relationship Advice', 'Dating Advice', 'Dating and Relationships']}\n",

Then, remember that your partner is a responsible adult. Is it really that bad to let them do what they feel is right for them?\\nI’d also do some deep soul-searching as to why the controlling behavior exists. What was your family dynamic as a child? Did you learn unhealthy behaviors or rationales from your family? Did they develop as a way of coping with others who struggled with mental illness, abuse or addiction? We tend to emulate our childhood role models, or we will grow up seeking people that allow us to keep the “role” we played in our family.\\nI’d also say that controlling behavior, jealousy, and the like are caused by insecurity or a low self-esteem.

According to my personal opinion, in a long-distance relationship following things should be maintained to keep the relationship strong and healthy:-\\nTrust - One of the most important pillars for a relationship to survive. Most of the times a relationship is ruined due to trust issues that creep up due to the distance. Both of you should trust each other and also should learn to give each other the required space. If either person gets worried or jealous do not get angry. On the contrary think that you are blessed with a person who does not see anything else except you.\\nBe Loyal - There are many things which we can do when we are away from our loved ones but a broken trust is just like a string which is broken from between. Once broken, it can be joined again but there will be a knot in between life long which cannot be removed.\\nGive Each Other time - There may be time differences, there may be work hour differences but make sure either of you give each other ample time and hear out each other about your daily activity. In this way by talking to each other and giving time to each other will make you feel that though there is a physical distance between you two, but your presence is always there with your partner\\nLove Truly - Last but not the least. Love and Live happily. That if done correct can never ruin a relationship at any cost.\\nThanks.\\nStay Blessed & Stay Safe', 'upvote': 1, 'view': 24, 'date': 'Apr 2, 2020'}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

I’ve explained this in one of my answers. here is the link for your first doubt.\\nhttps://www.quora.com/Do-all-gir...\\nFirst, it is true that person always want better than now. A “nothing” man seeks for “something”, and the achievement of “something” makes him greedy for something more than current “something”. And this goes on.\\nThis phenomena could not be recognized by most of the people, who cannot identify what and why they are doing, and they just flow.\\nSecond, ‘good looks’ provide a women her self-made self-value. This self value makes her to behave as the queen of her own. The attainment of a task which is impractical for society, gives a “winning” feel.\\nThe chance of multiple relationships could happen only if a women is dissatisfied with her relationship OR if the fact that possessing multiple relationships makes her feel victorious. Because a secretly done successful cheating has a subconscious effect just as winning, achieving something without letting anyone known, especially one of the partners.\\nI’ll edit my answer if I found something genuine than this.

Marriages used to last longer because people had no choice - they were stuck with their spouse no matter what. Now people can leave bad relationships.\\nThis is unequivocally a good thing.\\nWe have also changed the role of marriages. They used to be business decisions - people joined together for property reasons and alliances[1] . Even having children had property reasons - we started handing our property down through inheritance, so we started controlling the context under which children were born.\\nYour spouse was merely your business partner in that one of you provided children and the other provided resources for your survival. Or you both cooperated on providing survival resources (farm families, for instance, had both spouses working equally as hard on the farm, along with the kids and the grandparents and any other extended relatives and hired hands they could get to help). You didn’t have to like your spouse all that much, you just hoped to get along with them.\\nBut these days, relationships are so much more than that[2] . People get married for love. They get married for companionship. Your spouse is supposed to be your Everything now - your best friend, your lover, your confidante, your spiritual advisor, your co-parent, your business partner, your therapist, your activity partner - everything! Very few relationships can meet such high expectations for very long.\\nSo relationships don’t last “forever” because we expect too much of them. The higher your expectations for a relationship, the less of a chance it has to continue and that chance decreases over time.\\nWhich brings us back to divorce being a good thing, because you can leave a relationship that isn’t making you happy.\\nAnd the final reason why marriages don’t last as long now as they used to is that people who ask that question tend to be very ethnocentric. They’re seeing “marriage” through the lens of what it means today, in this time, and in this culture. it was much easier to get married “until death do we part” back when your spouse was probably going to die in their 50s. And not every culture has the same requirements for marriages. Some cultures don’t recognize anything that we would call “marriage” at all. Some have them for the duration of child-rearing. Some have built-in time limits. Some allowed divorce “if the man is repulsive” or if the woman is “obnoxious”.\\nOn top of that, divorce rates have actually dropped. Whenever no-fault divorces become legal in a region, the rates jump up as people who were previously trapped all rush to get out, but after all of them finally make it out, the divorce rates drops back down to “normal”.[3]\\nIn other words, this is sort of a cross-cultural form of confirmation bias - you’re seeing things that confirm your biases and not seeing the things that don’t confirm your bias because you are only familiar with your own culture.\\nBut the biggest reason is that we just made it easier for people to end relationships that aren’t working for them. This is a good thing.\\nFootnotes\\n[1] Stephanie Coontz: Do you take this man?
