From there the company began to grow and expand across the country and in those days he watched over the quality control of his product. There are stories about him going to a franchise, sampling the chicken, and if the product had been changed or not meet up to his standards, he would start yelling and cursing at the owner with the colorful language he was famous for, march back into the kitchen, gather up the pressure cookers that he had provided them with and remove them from the store.\nThat was the \u2018Original Kentucky Fried Chicken\u2019.\nIn 1964 he sold out the franchise for 2 million dollars and a lifetime salary, and it was shortly after that that he first started to publicly accuse the new corporate owners of changing his recipe and most noticeably complained about the change in his gravy. He was a stickler about all of the aspects of his meals but considered the gravy \"most sacred\". He referred to it (the changed recipe gravy) as \"sludge\" and \"wallpaper paste\".\nSo, what that means is that the original old KFC that you say you miss the tastes so much of, you would have to have eaten that particular chicken at one of the original Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises sometime during or prior to 1964.\nI am 72 years old and, as a young teen in growing up in Phoenix, Az, I don\u2019t recall ever having tasted any chicken from KFC, and if I had and I don\u2019t remember having done so, I can honestly tell you that there is no way I would be able to claim that I remember what the original tasted like.

Zhengzhou Fusmar Machinery is a professional pellet making machine\nmanufacturer. This article will tell us how to design a perfect formula, and how to allocate the proportion of each ingredient according to nutritional requirements.\nAccording to the characteristics of the feed, the common feed for broilers can divide into energy feed, protein feed, vitamin feed, mineral feed, and special additives feed. Feed pellet machine\nis dispensable equipment to make animal feed pellets.\nEnergy Feed\n1. corn: It is one of the most important energy feeds for broilers. Rich in starch and crude fat. When formulating the diet, the amount of corn generally accounts for 40% to 70% of the diet.\n2. broken rice: It is the broken grain rice screened in rice processing. The starch content is high, the crude fiber content is low, and it is easy to digest. Its nutritional value is similar to that of corn, and the dosage is about 30% to 50% of the diet.\n3. wheat: High nutritional value, energy content close to corn, more protein content, amino acid than other cereals, vitamin B is also very rich, palatability is good, the amount of easier to stick chicken mouth and affect feeding. It can generally account for 10% to 25% of the diet.\n4. barley: It contains 15% to 20% of the skin, the energy is about 75% of the corn, the crude fiber content is 3 times higher than the corn can account for 10% to 15% of the diet.\n5. rice bran: It is a by-product of rice processing, mainly composed of skin and rice embryo. Its crude fat, crude protein, and crude fiber content are higher than rice, rich in vitamin B, often used as auxiliary materials, the amount should not be too much, generally accounting for 8% to 10% of the diet.\n6. wheat bran: It is a by-product of wheat processing. It contains crude protein, vitamin B, and manganese, etc., has a laxative effect, the dosage should not be too large, the general broiler dosage does not exceed 8%.\nProtein Feed\nProtein feed can divide into plant protein feed and animal protein feed. Plant protein feeds such as bean cake, peanut cake, cottonseed cake, rapeseed cake, and so on. Animal protein feed such as fish meal, blood meal, meat and bone meal, feather meal, silkworm cocoon, and other processing by-products.\n1. bean cake: A by-product of soybean oil processing from soybean oil. Bean cake contains more than 40% protein, ranking first in plant protein feed, and is rich in lysine, with high nutritional value, generally accounting for 15% to 20% of the diet.\n2. cottonseed cake: its protein content is second only to the bean cake, up to 30% to 35%, but it should not be used simply as a dietary plant protein feed, because of the lack of lysine. The amount can not exceed 10% of the diet, because the cottonseed cake contains gossypol, too much feeding can cause poisoning.\n3. rapeseed cake: 25% to 30% crude protein, low lysine content, higher methionine content than bean cake, but the rapeseed cake contains mustard enzyme. Which can promote the decomposition of sinapinic acid into toxic substances, so the amount of feed should not be too much, generally less than 5%.\n4. Fish meal: It has high nutritional value and comprehensive amino acid content. The crude protein content of high-quality fishmeal is higher than 60%, the salt content is less than 2%, and the water content is below 12%. Fish meal can generally be used in an amount of 5% to 12% of the diet.\n5. Blood powder: It is a brown powder feed made by cooking, pressing and drying the blood of animals. The crude protein content is as high as 70%-80%, rich in lysine, but lacks methionine, cystine and isoleucine, and has low solubility. It is not easy to digest, and has poor palatability. It should be mixed with other protein feeds. Not more than 3% of the diet is appropriate.\nGreen Feed\nDue to the high moisture content of fresh green and green feed, the dosage should not be too large, so as to avoid causing squatting and affecting fattening of broilers. Green leaves, grass leaves, etc. are dried and pulverized to become high-quality grass powder or leaf powder, such as alfalfa powder, eucalyptus leaf powder, etc. are good vitamin supplement feeds, generally accounting for 2% to 5% of the diet.\nMineral Feed\nWhen the mineral content in natural feed is insufficient, or when some elements are unbalanced, attention should be paid to replenishing the mineral feed in the diet, especially for high-yield broiler breeders and broilers with fast-growing growth. Should pay attention to supplement. The commonly used mineral feeds are mainly the following:\n1. stone powder: Calcium content is 35% to 38%. The dosage generally accounts for 1% to 3% of the diet, and the broiler breeder can reach 5%.\n2. shell powder: Containing about 38% of calcium, often used as feed for calcium supplementation. It usually accounts for 1% to 3% of the diet, and up to 5% of the broiler breeders during the laying period.\n3. salt: In the preparation of the diet according to the actual salt content in the feed, and then consider the amount of salt added to avoid excessive or insufficient salt. The general dosage does not exceed 0.38% of the diet.\nAdditive Feed\nIn order to promote the normal growth of broilers, prevent the disease, increase the yield and economic benefits. In modern broiler breeding, the use of additives such as amino acids, vitamins, trace elements, antibiotics, antioxidants, antifungal agents. The types and dosages to add should determine according to actual needs. For example, in most feed diets, vitamins and trace elements are incomplete. It should note that appropriate proportions of multivitamins and trace element additives should add, generally accounting for 0.05% to 0% of the diet. It is often rainy and humid in summer, often with anti-fungal agents and antioxidants. Add the additive to the feed and mix well and mix well. Before the broiler is marketed, the feed should not contain any drugs.\nZhengzhou Fusmar Machinery provides complete feed pellet prodcution line\nfor chicken feed, and also we will provide perfect feed formula to customer for reference."], "topic_list": ["Broiling", "Broiler Chicken", "Poultry (food)", "Raising Chickens", "Chickens", "Perfection", "Chicken (food)", "Design", "Cooking", "Food"], "view_list": [107], "create_time": "Apr 14, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Amy Yan", "upvote_list": [0], "question_title": "How do you design a perfect feed formula for broilers?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "526", "name_list": ["Amy Yan"], "date_list": ["Apr 14, 2020"]}, "692": {"ans_list": ["If you have to ask on Quora, you are not smart enough to even try."], "topic_list": ["Gas Stoves", "Stoves", "Kitchen Appliances", "Cooking"], "view_list": [121], "create_time": "Apr 13, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Mary Wilson", "upvote_list": [1], "question_title": "How do I use a portable gas stove?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "1,100", "name_list": ["Jeff Burt"], "date_list": ["Apr 13, 2020"]}, "596": {"ans_list": ["The chocolate chicken of course!!"], "topic_list": ["History of Food", "Sweets", "Chocolate", "Eggs (food)", "Invention and Inventions", "Cooking", "History", "Food"], "view_list": [3], "create_time": "Apr 12, 2020", "no_of_follower": 3, "question_author": "Huy Nguyen", "upvote_list": [0], "question_title": "Who invented the chocolate egg?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "817", "name_list": ["Ric Cumming"], "date_list": ["Apr 12, 2020"]}, "289": {"ans_list": ["F is for fun U is uplifting N is for never-ending fun!", "Cooking is an art , it cannot be described", "Read your question it makes no sense."], "topic_list": ["Cooking Techniques", "Cooking Tips and Hacks", "Descriptions", "Cooking", "Food"], "view_list": [4, 3, 3], "create_time": "Apr 14, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Chris Franco", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "question_title": "What is the best way to describe the style of cooking?", "respond_collected": 3, "no_of_view": "591", "name_list": ["William Morley", "Rakhi Anand", "Gemini Keyes"], "date_list": ["Apr 16, 2020", "Apr 14, 2020", "Apr 14, 2020"]}, "324": {"ans_list": ["You can use whites, yolks, or whole eggs as glazes on pastries.

Although, they might sometimes be consumed at restaurants.\nPakistani cusine is spicier while Afghan is mild and closer to Iran.\nAfghan cuisine is based mainly on proper meal foods and bread. Both of which are closer to Iran yet still very unique.\nSimillarities with Iran:\nThere are many more foods that are eaten around cultural events like Samanak in Nowruz.\nBreads are extremely popular in both countries\u2019 cuisine and a staple. There are many different types of bread and overall both countries share less then they have in common but there are many that are shared. These are luckily sometimes found in the Indian Subcontinent but they aren't very popular.\nTypical Afghani nanwayi(bread stores) bread not considered the countries\u2019 national bread but it is the most popular usually non home cooked bread. Referred to as Barbari.\nIranian bread.\nDesserts are much closer to Iran, Qand, Qandi Pashmak, Shirpira and etc\u2026. This is due to how desserts sometimes just may have always been native to a place but most of the time it was developed at an exact time and place. During the Safavids, Afghanistan was under a lot of influence and adopted many desserts to the point they became native(some chefs may have been Afghan and some foods inspired by Afghan cuisine but it still would be Safavid). While, Mughal desserts are not too unpopular and some like Gulab Jamun, very popular but they are considered from Pakistan and India. while desserts with Iran are considered native.\nIran and Afghanistan have more similar drinks. Tea is served very similarly and the culture around it is very much the same. In Pakistan their tea usually comes with milk, like British tea except it's actually from the Indian subcontinent. Doogh which is the most popular drink after tea in Afghanistan is very popular in Iran of course.\nAfghans and Iranians love Kabobs more so than many other people, there are tons of varieties of kabobs and they are usually not as spicey as Indian or Pakistani.\nOne of the most traditional foods in Iran is Dizi and it can be considered the most popular food of Afghanistan but we call it Shorwa and it happens to be closer to Dizi than Chorba.\nShorwa - You put bread in it and eat it.\nThe food is usually eaten sitting on a comfy Doshak with a good Pushti.\nPushti is what you put your back to.\nOverall there are much more foods in common with Iran and these foods are usually more important to the culture. The food is generally not as spicey as Pakistani and the flavors are more like Iran. Afghans consider eating dall treason to their country. As tasty as Pakistani foods are, I would go as far as to say Afghan Cuisine is a complete different thing. There are no general similarities in flavors there are however foods eaten by both countries but then again The Afghan version will usually be less spicier.

When you cook meat two things will happen (well, more than two...).\nOne is that it will lose moisture. The longer you cook it the more moisture (i.e. water) you will lose, and there's no getting it back.\nThe second thing that happens is that the connective tissues break down to collagen, which is what you are perceiving as being moist and tender when you cook it for a long time. If it is cooked but not to the point where these connective tissues break down then it is likely a second cook will make it more tender. It will also continue to dry out the meat.\nAfter your second cook, be sure to let it rest. I would also suggest slicing it thinly against the grain after cooking as this will make it easier to chew, further helping with the mouthfeel.\nFinally, be aware that the amount of time the meat stays between 40\u00b0F-140\u00b0F the more risk there is of food poisoning. Cooking a second time does not eliminate any toxins produced by the bacteria up to that point (it will only kill bacteria), so be sure to eat it right away as letting it cool and reheating it again introduces more risk.

Add honey, salt and olive oil and whisk. Add flour and no matter how dry it looks, work it with a spoon and your fingers until it comes together as a dough. Add more water one tablespoon at a time if you need, but in my experience, this is almost never necessary.\nSprinkle some flour on the counter and knead the dough for a minute or two.\nIf you are finding this step difficult, one of the best tricks I picked up from my bread-making class is to simply pause. Leave the dough in a lightly-floured spot, put the empty bowl upside-down on top of it and come back in 2 to 5 minutes, at which point you will find the dough a lot more lovable.\nLightly oil a bowl (a spritz of cooking spray perfectly does the trick) - dump the dough in, turn it over so all sides are coated, cover it in plastic wrap and leave it undisturbed for an hour or two, until it has doubled in size.\n[Easiest way to tell if a dough has risen enough? Dip two fingers in flour, press them into the dough, and if the impression stays, it's good to go. If it pops back, let it go until it doesn't.]\nPreheat your oven to its highest temperature. If you have a pizza stone, put it in the oven for at least 15 minutes to warm up beforeputting the pizza on it.\nMeanwhile, make some sauce [recipe below].\nOnce the dough has doubled, turn it out onto a floured counter and gently deflate the dough with the palm of your hands. Form it into a ball and let it rest on a floured spot with either plastic wrap over it (sprinkle the top of the dough with flour so it doesn\u2019t stick) or an upended bowl. In 15 minutes, it is ready to roll out. Do so on the floured counter until pretty darn thin.\nPlace parchment paper on cake lifter and sprinkle with cornmeal, and build pizza on there. Once the dough is spread out to desired size, spread a thin layer of oil on the bread. Sprinkle some cheese on top of the oil. (The oil and cheese help prevent the bread from getting soggy from the sauce). Add the desired amount of sauce and then some extra cheese. Add desired toppings.\nSprinkle the pizza stone with cornmeal. If you don't have a pizza stone, sprinkle a baking pan with cornmeal. Open door and slide the pizza along with the parchment paper onto the stone, or put the pizza and parchment paper in the oven on a baking pan. [3/4 of the way through baking, remove the paper.

Poach the tomatoes for one minute only, and then drain them. As soon as they are cooled off enough that you can touch them, peel them. The peels should come right off. If they don\u2019t, make a slit in the skins. This always does the trick.\nDrain and dry the pot. Put it back on the burner over medium heat. Pour in olive oil and let it heat completely before adding the garlic and stirring it for a minute with a wooden spoon. Add the red pepper flakes and stir it for anther minute. You do not want the garlic to brown. Put the peeled tomatoes in the pot, along with the wine, sugar and salt. Break the tomatoes up with your spoon.\nLet the sauce simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down. Carefully taste without burning your tongue and adjust seasonings, if necessary.\nMakes enough for one small/medium pizza.\nBasic, Awesome Tomato Sauce\n1 tablespoon butter\n2 large shallots, finely chopped\n1/2 to 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes\n1 teaspoon salt\nA couple glugs red wine\n1 28-ounce can whole tomatoes\n1 15-ounce can pureed tomatoes\nMelt butter in saucepan over medium-high heat until foam subsides. Add shallots, red pepper flakes and salt, sauteing them together for a few minutes, until the shallots are translucent and beginning to color. Add the red wine, letting it sizzle and cook down slightly, then the whole and pureed tomatoes. Breaking the whole tomatoes up with a wooden spoon, let the sauce simmer for a few minutes. (No need to cook it down very much, as the extra liquid will be helpful to cook the pasta, and it will finish cooking in the oven.) Season to taste.\nMakes approximately 5 cups of sauce\nBasic Marinara Sauce\nMakes about 4 Cups\n- 1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes\n- 5 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2-3 Tablespoons fresh basil, minced\n- 1 Teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1/2 Lemon, juice only\n- Salt and pepper to taste\nYou can cook this sauce if you want to make it a bit thicker, but honestly, I just stick all the ingredients in a blender and blend them up. I like the fresh, light flavors.

Saute chicken until it is just done. Transfer cooked chicken to large bowl. Do not wash Dutch oven.\nFOR THE TOPPING: preheat oven to 450 F. Combine flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne in large bowl. Sprinkle butter pieces over top of flour. Using fingers, rub butter into flour mixture until it resembles coarse cornmeal. Stir in Parmesan. Add cream and stir until just combined. Crumble mixture into irregularly shaped pieces onto a baking sheet. Bake at 450-degrees until fragrant and starting to brown (10-13 minutes). Set aside.\nFOR THE FILLING: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, celery, salt and pepper. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender. Add in frozen peas and heat up for a few minutes. Transfer cooked vegetables to bowl with cooked chicken; set aside.\nHeat butter in empty Dutch oven over medium heat. When foaming subsides, stir in flour and cook 1 minute. Slowly whisk in chicken broth and milk. Bring to simmer and stir until sauce thickens, about 1 minute. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Then I put a glass or heavy plastic container on a kitchen scale and measure 200 grams of flour mixture into it. Next, I pour the exact same amount of clean, purified water (not tap water as it has chemicals and chlorine in it which kill your yeast and other bacteria essential for a healthy starter), 200 grams, and stir it up really well. Next I take the container\u2019s lid and rest it over the container without sealing it so that some air can circulate. Then I cover the whole thing with a lightweight dish towel, which will keep bugs from finding your starter and provide some darkness/privacy for the starter to get busy. I check on it after two days to see if it is bubbly. If not, wait another day, checking every 24 hours. When it is bubbly and raised, it is ready to be fed and/or used in a bread recipe. I feed my starter daily with 100 grams of water, 100 grams of flour mix, and 30 grams of starter. I throw away the old starter. If I am going to bake, then the DAY BEFORE I will make 400+ grams of starter by taking 210 grams of flour, 210 grams of water, and 30 grams of starter, mixing well , covering and, the next day I have enough starter for making four big loaves of bread. I hope this helps.

She explained that Imperial is a margarine, not butter. Back in the 1930s, when margarine became popular, the dairy industry raised a big fight when margarines compared themselves to butter, or called themselves \u2018corn oil butter\u2019 or \u2018vegetable butter\u2019 or whatever.\nIn the state of Wisconsin, which has a very big and powerful dairy industry, they even passed laws against artificial coloring in margarine, so their margarine came in white only! Like Crisco. A package of margarine came with a little yellow coloring packet that you mixed in yourself!\nSo Imperial didn\u2019t even want to use the word \u2018butter\u2019 in their advertising. They compared their margarine to the \u201970 cent spread\u2019. Which was butter. (This was a long time ago! 8^) ).\nApparently the laws have changed. Blue Bonnet is not butter at all, it\u2019s margarine. Would it take the place of butter in a recipe? Well, yes. For the recipe to work requires only -fat-. You could use coconut oil or corn oil or even lard. Your beignets might taste a little different or have a slightly different texture, but the recipe will work great. Most people wouldn\u2019t notice the difference. (I mean YOU would because you made them and you know what\u2019s in them, but those you feed them to probably wouldn\u2019t).

I am not certain as to exactly when he was born but it seems unlikely that he started business school at the age of 14, so are you sure that your claim is correct?!?

It is the most impressive resume for any chef in North America or Europe. I have read about younger chefs with extensive experience or training to win a Michelin star, but never heard something like this.\nI did not find any reliable source of what he has studied before. But its very impressive that he could land a job and someone would make him an executive chef of a Manhattan restaurant or he could rise to this status at such a young age. I had never heard of such success before. Btw, he was 22 when he became the Exec chef according to his post.\nI did some checking online and figured out from his social media that he keeps mentioning (in extremely long posts) that he was very young to hold the position and totally inexperienced, but was very passionate and worked very hard. It is still unheard of in restaurant industry.\nAnd then suddenly I made a connection through his last name that he was the owner\u2019s son. (it does not get mentioned anywhere though)\nThis answered all the doubts.\nWhen your father owns a business, he can inarguably give you any position and put media or pr behind it.

Which fits in nicely with all other biographical data on him I came across.\nHe started working at Junoon as an apprentice in 2012, at which point he probably was 19, but neither a chef, nor a Chef.\nJunoon already had a Michelin star at the time\u2013according to Michelin\u2019s website, they\u2019ve held one since they opened in 2010.\nAs far as I could tell from various sources, he was promoted to executive Chef of Junoon either in 2016 or 2017. At which point he would have been 24-ish. Which is rather young for an executive Chef of a top restaurant, but not outrageously so.\nHis achievement was to keep up the standards of Junoon\u2019s kitchen to a level that they \u201ckept\u201d, or rather: were re-awarded their star the year he took over. Which is an impressive feat all by itself, but arguably not quite as impressive as earning one for a newly opened restaurant, or one that didn\u2019t have one before.\nThe thing is: Michelin stars are actually awarded to restaurants, not Chefs.\nAs far as being the youngest Michelin-starred Chef in the world at 24 is concerned: Tommy Banks won \u201chis\u201d first Michelin star at that age, Aiden Byrne was apparently 22, for example. There probably are others, but these two were what a quick Google search came up with.\nSo, no. He isn\u2019t the youngest Chef to ever be awarded a Michelin star.

They often come with a layer of fat on one side. I like to cut that off and use some of it to \u201cgrease\u201d the pan by putting it in the pan while it heats. The fat will sizzle and you can move it around the pan to spread the fat around.\nWhen you are ready to cook the steak take it out of the fridge and let it sit for about an hour before cooking. After cooking allow it to sit on the plate for five minutes to allow the juices to redistribute before cutting it. Once you taste a strip steak you will understand why I like them so much.", "If you are cooking it on the stove top or grilled . Get a steak that's said it's a new York strip steak prime cut.", "Ribeye, and the phrase, \u201cmedium-rare\".", "Ok, I had to check just now where you\u2019re coming from, so I can see that you\u2019re from OZ. This is important, because you have a different way of grading (judging the quality) than Canada, the US or Japan.\nHere\u2019s the comparison charts for 3 of the standards. Canada\u2019s is similar to the US, except instead of words, we call it A, AA and AAA.\nSo here\u2019s MY TOP FOUR CRITERIA where you should be starting with how to look for a steak.\nFIRST - The HIGHER the grade, the more expensive.\nJudging from your grading scale, I would say MS6 to MS9 would be restaurant quality meat, and most supermarkets would be more rated at MS2 to MS5. For the best flavor, you go with the higher grade as there would be more fat in the steak. I\u2019ll explain why when I explain MARBLING below.\n(From meatnbone[1])\nSECOND - MARBLING fat in the meat\nThe more marbled the meat, the higher the quality. There\u2019s only one real exception, the Filet Mignon, but I\u2019ll explain that later.\nHere\u2019s how it\u2019s judges in Australia:\n(From Wagyu International[2])\nSee how the little fat lines get into the meat at each of these 9 levels of steaks? That\u2019s the difference that you\u2019re looking for, as fat in the beef improves the tenderness and imparts a buttery taste as it gets higher.\nTHIRD - THE CUT of the Beef\nDepending on what part of the cow the steak is cut from, the most tender it can get with the most flavor. I won\u2019t explain those areas for now as it can get to be confusing, and won\u2019t make any difference really. There\u2019s only a few that I would be recommending.\n(From Otto Grills[3])\nHere\u2019s what I prefer from top to bottom of the most common cuts.\nFilet Mignon - This is considered to be by many as the top of the top. It\u2019s super expensive as this baseball sized piece of meat is all you can get from an ENTIRE cow. It\u2019s personally not my favorite cut, as I find it not as tasty as it\u2019s from the tenderloin, the least flavorful part of the cow, but there\u2019s plenty here who would worship this if they could.\nCooking a Filet needs a bit of finesse, and even I don\u2019t like to cook it myself. Supermarkets tend not to offer this, but it\u2019s pretty easy to get one directly from a butcher. There\u2019s not as much fat and the meat itself is supremely tender on it\u2019s own despite the lack of fat like in a rib steak.\n(From smoking-meat.com[4])\nPrime Rib Steak (Ribeye steak with bone-in) - I find this to be the best as it incorporates the best that a steak needs, tender beef, soft fat, and a bone to happily gnaw on. MY FAVORITE. It\u2019s usually not too pricey too.\n(From Honest Grade Meats[5])\nRibeye with Rib Cap then the Eye of Ribeye - It\u2019s still the same cut of steak, just without the bone. The Ribcap has extra connective tissue and fat, which imparts a LOT of flavor when cooked.\n(from Amazing Ribs[6])\nT-Bone and Porterhouse - These steaks are almost indistinguishable, and both are cut more or less from the same area, but one from the front of that part, and the other from the back of that part. There\u2019s plenty who call the Porterhouse as a king of steaks, and regard it better than the T-Bone.\nIt\u2019s still a pretty tasty steak regardless. I like grilling these from time to time. They also tend to be slightly more expensive than the Rib steak.\n(From Barbecue Bible[7])\nStriploin (also known as NY Strip or Sirloin in the UK) - Cut from another part of the cow, it can get to be fatty and still has a LOT of flavor.\n(from Jett Foods - Australian M5 strip[8] )\nSirloin (can also be called Top Sirloin or Rump in the UK) - This is probably the most popular overall in pubs and breakfast dishes (steak and eggs and such) because it can be tasty, and done right, can be reasonably well done. However, it\u2019s also VERY lean with little fat, and can be TOUGH. This is my least favorite common steak, and I don\u2019t really recommend it. There are those who love this cut, and when grinded up into ground beef, it can make a REALLY tasty hamburger beef patty.\nThere are two more that you can grill (though I find them really tough meats, and needs to be cut super thin and tenderized personally), the Tri-Tip and the Flank, and I wouldn\u2019t recommend you starting with these ones. When done right and tenderized, they can be incredibly tasty though. This would be better for a Steak 201 class.\nFOURTH - HOW IS THE MEAT FINISHED\nThis is more of a gourmet thing. All cows pretty much start the same way as they are fed with grass, then get moved to another food for the rest of their lives.\nThere are FOUR key foods that affects the taste of the meat.\nCORN AND SOY - Most cows that you get from the supermarket will probably be finished with corn.\nGRASS - This is more of a boutique feed for cows. The idea is that the cows are fed with lots of grass through it\u2019s entire life, but there MIGHT be some finishing with either grain (wheat) or corn as a grass-fed rancher had explained it to me that it\u2019s difficult to go completely grass fed finished. . Most cattlemen say that the meat is healthier and sweeter. You usually find this in a butcher shop or a farmer\u2019s market. Higher end steak houses tend to use this beef.\nWHEAT & BARLEY - Cows that are finished with this are the superstar elite of the steak world. Japanese cows (aka known as Wagyu, but also the famous Kobe and Matsumsaka sub-brands of Wagyu) are finished with this. This leads to reaaaally tasty tender steaks, but also really SUPER $$$ elite prices as well. Think $300\u2013400 US per steak. Only gourmet shops (and really good elite supermarkets) tend to carry this. Matsusaka and Kobe is considered to be the top of the top of these type of Japanese steaks, and is virtually impossible to eat anywhere outside of Australia except for a few restaurants around the world (only NINE in the entire USA).\nThere\u2019s a few more things here and there that matter, but just like Tri-Tip and Flank, that\u2019s a Steak 201 course. But this would be everything you need to start enjoying your explorations in Steak science!\nEDIT: I was reminded that I forgot to mention how WET AGING AND DRY AGING the meat (wet and dry aged) influenced the taste of the meat. Actually, it looks like I would be writing a STEAK 201 addition as I didn\u2019t plan on covering it in this message as that\u2019s more of a gourmet issue. For the OP, steak that\u2019s freshly slaughtered is like trying to eat leather. ALL meat needs to be aged (so it breaks down) in order to be edible.\nIn this Answer, I was covering more supermarket steaks as that\u2019s what I would assume you would be sourcing from to begin with. Supermarket steaks are \u201cWet Aged\u201d for 10\u201314 days before they\u2019re made available for sale. But DRY-AGED steaks are much better in flavor and tenderness and start at 21-days up to even a YEAR. The longer the meat is aged to break down and intensify in flavor, the more expensive as a rule of thumb.\nFootnotes\n[1] Beef 301: Meat N' Bone's Guide to labeling beef (From Choice to Wagyu A5)\n[2] The Wagyu cattle breed produces superior eating quality.

Black rice, red rice, wild rice are all whole grains and all more firm in texture than refined white rice. But if you want named rice to be nutritious, you need to choose a brown jasmine rice or a black sticky rice.\nI should note that my answer pertains only to rice. Other grains, like barley and farro, have different rules. For instance, with those two you should avoid the term \u201cpearled\u201d in the description.

Sulforaphane, present in brassicas and nowhere else in large quantities, helps fight many illnesses, including cancer.\nHeat destroys myrosinase, so cooking broccoli (florets and leaves) for the shortest period of time in the smallest amount of water (quick steaming) retains more of it. Chopping it up into small pieces, though, and letting it sit for 40 minutes or longer, develops the most sulforaphane. The longer it sits, the more sulforphane is released. Also, chewing raw florets is beneficial. When I prepare broccoli, kale, or cauliflower, I always chew on a few raw pieces.\nThere are many antioxidants formed in the brassicas\u2014different ones are released at different points along the process, which target specific areas of the body, especially in the alimentary canal. So, eating some of it fresh and raw, cooking some of it right after chopping, and cooking some of it after letting it sit, chopped, for 40 minutes will give you the broadest range of antioxidants.\nIncidentally, frozen broccoli has been blanched, destroying myrosinase. So you won\u2019t get these benefits from frozen broccoli\u2026 unless\u2026 you sprinkle a tiny amount of dry mustard on the broccoli while it\u2019s being prepared. Mustard is another plant in the Brassicaceae family, and it reintroduces myrosinase to the broccoli.", "Is it true that cutting broccoli releases its nutrients?\nNo, not appreciably. Not in the sense of nutrients being lost. If you prefer chopped broccoli, it is fine to chop it up. You can eat it lightly steamed. Cooking too much can reduce some nutrients. I like to rinse the broccoli, remove the florettes, chop the heavier stems into bite sized pieces. Then put the stem pieces in a pan with a little oil, or in a steamer, and cook covered until they are tender, then add the bite sized florettes, and cook lightly. They should be bright green and a little crisp. Don't over cook. You can eat them alone, or with other veggies, or add to stir fry meat, or tofu. Whatever you like. Just start with the pieces that need to cook longest, and finish with the florettes or other veggies that don't need much cooking. Mushy broccoli is not very tasty.\nIt is true that the heavier stalks of the broccoli are more digestible after cooking, so in that way more nutrients are available to you. The heaviest part of the stem might get woody. I trim that part off. I would never boil broccoli. The broth from the steamer can be reserved for soup. The only veggies I boil are potatoes.\nTry broccoli, snow peas, and slivered almonds.\nIt is Spring here. The Purple Sprouting Broccoli I planted last Fall is producing a lot of florettes. I am eating them almost every day. If I keep picking them, they will produce until mid Summer.\nIn the garlic beds, the garlics I missed digging up last Summer have sprouted clumps of green garlic's. I am digging them out, replanting the biggest ones, and chopping the smaller shoots like scallions ( green onions). I add these to my veggies when I cook them.\nTry lightly steaming the florettes, chilling with ice, then sprinkling with lemon or vinegar. Add these to green salads.\nSometimes organic broccoli has aphids on the florettes. Not to worry. A quick soak in brine, and a good spray of water will remove them all. It is completely edible.\nIf you are growing Broccoli, harvest the center stalk a little higher up. Leave some side stems. They will grow out, and produce many smaller heads which you can also harvest. These stems after harvest will produce many more smaller broccoletti. Eventually they are too small to mess with. Harvest the seeds when they form, and sprout them in the kitchen next winter to add to a winter salad. The plant will make little long bean like seed pods. Collect them when the seeds are fully formed, and the pods are starting to dry out and get brown. If you wait too long they will pop open and scatter the seeds. You can finish drying them in a loose bag. Use an appropriate sieve to separate the seeds from the dried pods. Or winnow them if you know how. Broccoli sprouts are very good for you.", "The three factors that lead to nutrient loss are heat, oxygen, and light. The interiors of uncut produce are protected from oxygen and light but exposed when cut. The nutrient that suffers the heaviest hit in cut fruits and vegetables is probably vitamin C, although some vitamin A and vitamin E get lost as well. According to recent research in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, raw broccoli provides significantly more of this beneficial nutrient than cooked. Cooking locks sulforaphane in, making it unavailable to your body, Bottom Line, if you like broccoli, eat it raw. it's more nutritious.", "No.\nCutting food does not \u201crelease vital nutrients\u201d at all. That\u2019s all just misinformation.\nCooking food can do that, because heat can in a way, encourage the nutrients to come out. But then again some vitamins cannot survive the temperature and die, losing some.\nMost studies say that cooked vegetables are usually better than raw, but raw veggies are still nutritional and healthy.\nI hope this helps.", "No. It's a nonsensical idea. In the first place, any broccoli you buy in the store has already been cut when it was harvested. In the second place, while any method of cooking may destroy certain heat sensitive nutrients, simply slicing or dicing any vegetable reduces it to smaller pieces, without making any other changes.

I use either size depending on how much I am cooking. If I am only cooking a small amount for 1 or 2 people, I'll use that size cooker.\nSupposedly the slow cooker is meant to be used when you work all day, and want to come home, and your meal is finished cooking, and all you need to do is set your place setting up at your dinning room table, or your kitchen table. Don't forget to turn off your slow cooker. Do not let any vegetables or meat stay in the cooker once it's finished cooking. As it will be too soggy. And may lose its flavor.\nThe vegetables and meat, all go in at one time, cook for 8 hours, and it should be ready when you arrive home. Or sooner if you elect a higher level of cooking.. say, 4 hours. Or 6 hours, you should be able to decide how long you want it to cook..hopefully you will have a cooker that automatically shuts itself off when the cooking cycle is complete. .or that it at least goes to the warm cycle.\nThe only two drawbacks I find in using a slow cooker is, the vegetables are apt to be over cooked. Which can not be helped because everything goes into the pot at once. My second issue is, the meat is cooking in its own juices. And this can be a little greasy. Fat, from the grease from the meat. So, before I would attempt to make a gravy from the juices, I would remove the meat, keep it warm on a platter, covered, so it doesn't dry out. Then I would drain the juice from the slow cooker, separate the fat from it. Then in a separate pan on the stove, make a rue. This is done with butter and flour combined quickly, gradually add, the meat juice, little bit at a time, stir quickly to get out lumps, season to taste with salt & pepper, and other herbs of your choice.", "Many tougher cuts of beef, sold specifically as \u201cstewing beef\u201d or a \u201cpot roast\u201d for example, contain a lot of a substance called \u201ccollagen\u201d that holds the muscle fibers together and not a lot of fat. They\u2019re from a part of the animal that gets a workout, like its shoulders and hind quarters. The tender cuts are from the muscles that the animal hardly ever used, which contain a lot of fat but not much collagen. There are cuts of mutton that are similar.\nIf you try to cook these tougher meats fairly quickly (like you would a steak) or roast them at high temperatures (like a roast), the collagen binds to itself and to the meat, making it even tougher. The same would happen if, for some strange reason, you wanted to boil it like pasta.\nHowever, if you slow cook it at lower temperatures (and it\u2019s not just that simple, get yourself some knowledge about braising) the collagen eventually becomes a liquid, which separates the muscle fibers it usually binds together. The meat becomes tender instead of tougher. This process can\u2019t be rushed and has to be \u201clow and slow\u201d to get the right results.\nTrue barbecue uses the same technique with hot air rather than a little hot water.", "Any form of cooking needs to get the interior to a certain temperature (varies by food). Traditional cooking does so by making the outside quite hot, for a short period of time, since the rate of heat transfer is proportionate to the temperature difference. Slow cooking uses temperatures only slightly above the desired internal temperatures, which takes far longer, but avoids burning the outside and also provides more time for flavors to blend.

This way, you can get more used to the heat without having to be near actual fire. Then, when you feel ready to start working with a stove, try using a stove without actual flames. Don\u2019t cook anything complicated, or anything with hot oil that can splatter. Try maybe some pasta, possibly even homemade pasta because that doesn\u2019t have to cook as long. Keep working with the stove, eventually making recipes using hot oil. And then, when you finally feel ready, you can use a real gas stove. Turn it on and keep it on low, and don\u2019t freak out if the flames jump out a little when you first turn it on. Be careful with the real stove. Tie long hair back, don\u2019t wear very loose clothing, and use a potholder if it makes you feel safer.

I personally prefer cast Iron, due to it's ability to hold heat and maintain a more even temperature with less cost in gas, electricity or wood. Mostly it comes down to what you prefer. I will say that if I were to choose stainless I would want it coated in ceramic. Pure copper ware heats evenly but loses heat fairly quickly as well. Copper is an expensive metal, so expect higher costs. Cast Iron is the least attractive without an outer coating of enamel or other materials.\nPresently I live outside of the United States, so most cookware is expensive. Most of my pans are ceramic coated stainless steel, as cast iron is hard to find, is expensive and most is lacking in quality.", "There is no \u201cbest pan\u201d for all situations. Some pans are better than others depending on what your are cooking, what sort of stovetop you are using, your budget, and what sort of results you are looking for.\nPlain cast iron is great for certain applications (searing anything, for example), it is inexpensive and incredibly durable, and can be made non-stick through proper seasoning. It can be used with any heat source but is not recommended for glass cooktops because it might scratch them. Cast iron also has great heat retention. On the downside, it requires more care (it must be hand washed and throroughly dried after use or it will rust) and the seasoning requires regular maintenance. Similar to cast iron is plain carbon steel. They are still relatively rare in the U.S. but they\u2019re making a comeback. This material works very similar to cast iron, but is lighter and will heat faster. It is a bit more expensive than cast iron, but still affordable. Carbon steel must be seasoned, like cast iron, but the seasoning is a bit more difficult to achieve and maintain.\nThere are also enameled cast iron pans, which give you most of the advantages of plain cast iron, but don\u2019t require seasoning. The enamel is a glass based material which is non-reactive, so you can cook anything in it. These pans are great for \u201clow and slow\u201d cooking. You can have a soup or stew simmering all day on the stovetop if you want. They can also go in the dishwasher, but I still prefer to wash mine by hand \u2014 the dishwasher can discolor the enamel and the pan should last longer washing by hand. The enamel is not as non-stick as a properly seasoned plain cast iron pan, but food doesn\u2019t stick nearly as much as it can with stainless steel. The enamel coating can chip and flake off on these, especially with the cheaper ones, but the pan can still be used even if the enamel chips. Underneath the enamel is just cast iron, which is non-toxic. The higher quality enameled pans can be quite expensive.\nStainless steel by itself makes for a pretty lousy pan that is only good for boiling things. It is a poor conductor of heat, which results in hot spots. A clad stainless pan (a good heat conductor, such as aluminum or copper is sandwiched between layers of stainless) gives you an incredibly durable and useful pan that heats more quickly and evenly than plain stainless. Stainless is very low maintenance (no seasoning) and can be washed in the dishwasher. It is non-reactive, so you can cook anything in it. However, food will stick to it, and when that happens it becomes much harder to clean than cast iron. Also, some stainless pans will not work on an induction cooktop, but any stainless pan can be used with any other heat source. On the downside, a good quality clad stainless pan will be expensive.\nBare copper should never be used for cooking. Copper is toxic in even small quantities, and if you cook in a bare copper pan, the copper will leach into your food. If the inside of the copper is clad with a non-reactive material (such as stainless), it makes for an excellent, although very expensive, pan. Copper is nearly the best heat conductors known \u2014 even better than aluminum, so a copper clad pan will heat very quickly and evenly, and will retain heat better than aluminum.\nAluminum makes for a pretty good pan. A well made bare aluminum pan can be very durable, and they\u2019re pretty inexpensive. Aluminum will heat quickly and evenly, but does not retain heat very well, so it\u2019s not a good choice for searing. It can be used with any heat source except induction. The downside is that it is reactive, so it shouldn\u2019t be used for acidic foods. It also can\u2019t be washed in the dishwasher, but must be washed by hand. It will not rust like cast iron, but food can stick to it. There were news stories several years ago that linked aluminum to Alzheimer\u2019s. Some people avoid bare aluminum for this reason, but subsequent studies have shown no link between cooking with aluminum pans and Alzheimer\u2019s. Aluminum can leach into your food, but you will ingest more aluminum by taking an antacid, so the risk is pretty low.\nAnodized aluminum (I\u2019m talking about plain anodized without a non-stick coating) makes an excellent pan for many uses. It has all of the benefits of bare aluminum, plus the anodizing makes the pan non-reactive, so you can cook anything on it. The anodized layer also prevents aluminum from leaching into your food, so these pans are completely safe. They can go in the dishwasher, but it\u2019s not really recommended. The are inexpensive, but very difficult to find. Food can stick to it, but not as bad as with stainless or bare aluminum.\nCeramic wasn\u2019t listed, but has a lot of advantages as a material for cookware. The most common is Visions by Corning, but even that is difficult to find. The material is very much like glass or Pyrex, but more heat resistant. These pans are very durable, so long as you don\u2019t drop them, in which case they will shatter into many pieces. They withstand heat and thermal shock very well, but I don\u2019t push it. I wouldn\u2019t take one of these pans from the freezer to the broiler even though the manufacturer says you can. I also wouldn\u2019t use them for high heat applications, like searing a steak. But they are very good pans for anything else. The glass-like material is pretty non-stick. I have cooked eggs on them without sticking, and if food does stick, a good soak in soapy water will take care of it. The material is completely non-reactive, so you can cook anything in them. They also go in the dishwasher with no problem. The biggest advantage is you can see through them, so you don\u2019t have to take off the lid to see how your food is doing. They don\u2019t conduct heat very well, so they\u2019re slow to heat up. They can be used with any heat source except induction, and can even go in the microwave. I don\u2019t know of any other pan that can both go on the stovetop and in the microwave.\nLast (and in my opinion, least) is non-stick pans. I\u2019m not a fan. The non-stick coating is too delicate in my opinion to make for a good pan. You can\u2019t use metal utensils (this is the only type of the pan in the list with that limitation), and even if you baby the pan it won\u2019t last very long. If you overheat it, the coating can release toxic fumes into the air. Again, this is the only type of pan with that drawback. All the others will last a lifetime as long as you don\u2019t abuse them. As for the non-stick properties, you can get nearly as good with a properly seasoned cast iron or carbon steel pan. I\u2019ve never had anything stick to either of them.", "Depends on what and how you are cooking. If you are browning meats, cast iron gives you a better result including all the bits stuck to the bottom which should be deglazed for a sauce. For a tomato based sauce, stainless steel is better. The acidity in tomatoes can ruin the seasoning on cast iron, but stainless or enamel lined cast iron are immune. Copper ok too but if you are using traditional tin lined pots don't leave anthing tomatoey in it long after cooking. It will ruin the lining. Copper or enamel lined cast iron not good for super high heat. That kind of heat can ruin both. Copper is good for moderate to gentle saut\u00e9ing, sauces, soups.", "I think that it varies depending upon the dish, but I do like cast iron for the way It holds the heat. Hard to clean.

Even then, unless it\u2019s a thick enough piece of metal, the stainless steel will get hot spots and it\u2019s not a good heat distributor.\nCopper isn\u2019t good by itself because it can react with foods, so you need to get it lined with tin or stainless steel, in which case it can be really good for a saucepan or a pot.\nStainless steel is good for pots that are going to be used for boiling water, simmering stews and chili, etc.", "Stainless is my go to cookware. It is easy to clean and acidic food like say with vinegar won't react with it.

However, in my experience of cooking I can answer about the following.\nI have 2 copper pans with stainless steel liners, which are fantastic to look at when polished and hanging from hooks, they also heat quickly and evenly too.

I usually try to cover it with coals as well. In the morning it\u2019s a brand new pan.

Fill a large enough basin with enough water to completely immerse the pan, add some lye, stir it with a stainless steel implement (lye will discolor wood and bamboo but not badly for a brief exposure), and leave the pan to soak for a few hours. The encrusted stuff will scrape off easily. If it\u2019s particularly bad it may take a second treatment.\nUSE CAUTION WHEN WORKING WITH LYE. It\u2019s very caustic in concentrated solution, can burn your skin, and is especially hazardous for your eyes. If there are other people in your household be sure to place a big obvious warning over the basin while the pan is soaking. I usually just draw a big skull and crossbones on a sheet of card stock and write LYE in big black letters with a Sharpie. Everyone in my family knows what that means.\nFor clean up you can flush it down the drain and rinse the pan, basin, and any utensils with water.

Find the spaghetti and read the boiling time. Some are 2 minutes, some are 12, read the package. Get maybe a bunch that\u2019s the diameter of a dime or nickel.

Grab your bowl and use your fork to scrape the spaghetti over the edge of the pot into the bowl.

Even if you are leaving for just a second, turn off the burner. It is SO easy to get distracted and melt a pot onto the stove.\nSecond rule, clean up after yourself. There should be zero evidence that you cooked (other than there is less food). Scrub all that you used and to really be good, dry them and put them away. Don\u2019t give your parents any reason to complain. Even better, clean the stove and counter top and put away the pot before you eat your spaghetti.

You cook it until it is no longer pink, inside or out.\nBeef and chicken are the main staple proteins besides perhaps eggs.\nEggs are fairly simple too, with a variety way to prepare them.

Unfortunately these are extremely hard fats and don't always have a good mouthfeel. So the manufacturers have learned how to take the fatty acids off the glycerin backbone and rearrange them in ways that make more functional fats. It's not nearly as easy or as versatile as hydrogenating oils but it gets the job done.\nIf you mean starting with carbon, oxygen and hydrogen and building a fat up from nothing, the reality is that would be an energy intensive waste of time.

If you take care of them, the only reason you might need to replace one is if there's a catastrophic cooking failure.\nDon't let them sit in water. Most baking sheets are actually two layers of metal with an air pocket inside. If you let the sheet sit in water, water will get into that pocket and damage the sheet from the inside out. It's better to hand wash them and let them sit to dry than to toss them in the dishwasher.\nIf they do need to soak for whatever reason, like you can't scrub the food off, put your oven on a low temperature and put the sheet inside for about ten or fifteen minutes; the low heat will evaporate the moisture.\nClean them after every use. Whether that means wiping out crumbs or scrubbing them, do it.\nFor easy cleanup, line the sheets. Aluminum foil and baking parchment are popular choices, and silicon mats are also a good choice. Make certain that if you choose parchment paper, that it's actually oven-safe; there are at least three kinds of kitchen parchment paper and only two of them are oven-safe. The other is not and will catch fire. It'll be marked on the box if you can put it in the oven. You should throw away the foil or parchment after use or wash the silicon mat and inspect the sheet for crumbs or grease.\nThat's really it. Don't let the inside get wet and clean them after every use and try lining the sheets.\nTo rescue an aluminum sheet, you can try several methods. Ketchup, baking soda and vinegar, and damp alum powder will all remove rust. Let the sheet sit with your choice of rust-remover, add some elbow grease, and you might be able to save the sheet. I don't recommend using something abrasive, like steel wool or a scrub pad, because it'll leave scratches; instead, just use a regular sponge or a dish wand or a toothbrush.\nWith that said, I believe I bought my aluminum sheets at Target. They came in a pack of three sheets in different sizes. They're lightweight and have held up extremely well. Unless I really screw up and char something onto them, I don't expect I'll have to replace them for several more years.", "I prefer stone. Does not scratch. Does not rust.

I've read that ceramic will break too easily.\nI\u2019m half tempted to not even bother answering this since everything I write somehow manages to violate Quora\u2019s alleged \u201cpolicy\u201d and Quora\u2019s alleged \u201cmoderation\u201d obviously doesn\u2019t understand the English language so here goes as this might well be the last time I waste anymore time trying to share information on Quora\u2026\nFirst off, I avoid using aluminum for cooking and baking, but, nonetheless, some of my baking pans are indeed aluminum. Aluminum is a unique metal which oxidizes almost immediately upon contact with air. Yup, that\u2019s right, it rusts really quickly and far faster than most any other metal. This is why if you watch welders working on aluminum, they\u2019ll clean the weld area immediately before running the bead, then stop to clean the next section before continuing to weld. This is because of how fast the oxides form on aluminum and those oxides are detrimental to weld quality just the same as they\u2019re detrimental to food and your health.\nThus, I never scrub any of my aluminum baking pans and I never use an aluminum baking pan until it\u2019s seasoned. Yes, you read that right, I did indeed say \u201cseasoned\u201d in the similar manner as one would season a cast iron or carbon steel skillet. I use an oil with a low smoke point for cast iron, but for aluminum I like using cheap oil despite my aversion to using GMO sourced oils for cooking, it works fine for seasoning be it vegetable, canola, corn or whatever. Apply a very thin coating of oil to the pan, I use a cotton rag. The place in a 500\u00b0F/260\u00b0C oven and let it bake until the oil has solidified on the surface. Repeat this process several times until the surface of the pan is completely covered with a tan-brown coating. At this point the aluminum has been fully sealed and will not come in contact with the food, not to mention it\u2019ll also be fairly non-stick as well especially if you apply a coating of fresh oil before using the pan. Sorry, I don\u2019t have a picture handy, but suffice to say that none of my aluminum baking pans are shiny on the food side, they\u2019re various shades of cured oil brown. - MarkKw", "I made a couple of pounds of croutons last night with some bread that was getting stale.

And even when you aren't covering the pans, like I did with my croutons last night, do not get the pans hot enough to cause ingredients or fats to get burned into the pans, ABSOLUTELY DO NOT EVER use any kind of cooking spray (which has polymers that act as glue when heated), and always wash and take care of your pans like a professional cook would.\nAlso, make sure any aluminum anything is washed by hand and never put it into the dishwasher. Dishwashers use oxygen to clean, which will oxidize your aluminum, creating a porous, rough surface that will make dirt easier to adhere to.\nIt is not only gross to see, but it is also dangerous. Those pans that turn black are turning that color because of years of built up grease, fat, food, soap, and haphazard cleaning, combined with bacteria and any cleaning chemical you used in the past.

Place each patty on to a chargrilled half bun with a little wilted lettuce, a small slice of tomato and a slice of tinned beetroot. Avoid garlic, pickles or other spices. Place other half of bun on top and serve.

Grazie Rome!\nAnother way to start is to check out a cook book you already have or a great, easy-to-follow cook online eg, Delia Smith. If it\u2019s a general cookbook (like say Delia\u2019s summer cookbook), flick through and see what catches your eye and that is not from your home country. Start there. Or google Delia French or Delia Greek and see what pops up. Start with the countries you know or whose food you have tried so you get used to following an unfamiliar recipe through to a semi-authentic outcome. If you\u2019ve had quiche Lorraine or spanakopita or moussaka before, then it\u2019s a good place to start because you know where you\u2019re heading. These are also great \u2018first\u2019 recipes because a ham tart or spinach pie or a kind of shepherd\u2019s pie/lasagna is familiar enough. And you\u2019re just adjusting to just a few, perhaps, new to you ingredients.\nSide note.. some out there may guide you to \u2018authentic\u2019 cookbooks and I say yes to that. Absolutely. If you are a skilled and experienced cook. I love Madhur Jaffray and she does write recipes for novice cooks, but she also writes recipes that, in my opinion, are best suited to professional Indian chefs. Love her, but some of her recipes would be terrifying for someone cooking Indian food for the first time. It\u2019s OK to google \u2018simple\u2019 along with a great chef from a country just to make sure you have a good experience. And read the whole thing to decide if it is \u2018simple\u2019 for you first. Like Martha Stuart\u2019s recipes\u2026 who has three days to make breakfast pastries? Not me for damn sure however amazing they look.\nAs your confidence builds, explore further and head to other continents\u2026 Thai curries, for example, are easy with pre-made authentic pastes, but maybe you want to start from scratch. Well isolation is both the perfect time to start curry cooking because it needs time, but also a bad time because all curries needs LOTS of ingredients you may not have or be able to source. The key is to not replace too many ingredients because then you may find you have strayed too far away from that country\u2019s food. Of course this is only true if authenticity is your goal. If fusion is your goal, go for it. Again, googling \u2018can I replace curry leaves with curry powder\u2019 will helpfully tell you why you absolutely cannot. Sherry and Marsala on the other hand, no problem. Moving geographically can also help because cuisines overlap\u2026 moving from French to Cambodian could work because they have an overlapping food history because of their history history, but it would be easier for a cook new to making food from this region to move from Cambodian to Vietnamese food\u2026 if only for reusing cooking techniques and ingredients.\nGood luck and have fun as you travel cook.", "Mexico!

You need a crust recipe without too much yeast so your crust doesn't end up like bread. If you're looking for pizza hut style then maybe you do but that's an issue in itself. Next you need a sauce that tastes just right. I use my wife's marinara sauce with a bit of oregano. You also need to use the right amount of sauce something like 2/3-3/4 cup for a 14 - 15 inch pie. Next you need a good quality cheese, I like Poly-O. Finally you need high heat. Believe it or not most pizzerias do not cook in wood fired ovens at 700 degrees. The ones that do will produce a product that you will not duplicate in a home oven.

If you buy it pre-made, take it out of the bag the day before you need it. It should double in size. If it doesn\u2019t, you need to add some heat. I sometimes put mine in a bowl on top of the toaster oven covered with a towel and put the toaster oven on toast every few hours. Fermented dough is critical to taste. If you make your own, you can add lager beer in place of some water. The beer will replicate the fermented taste of quality dough.\nMake your own sauce, and don\u2019t cook the sauce before using it. Use canned San Marzano tomatoes if you can find them, or just Italian canned tomatoes. Add a small can of tomato paste. The sauce will cook on the pizza. Using jarred sauce will give you crappy pizza: you might as well buy frozen..\nOregano is critical to the pizza sauce, but don\u2019t overdo it. Add a couple of table spoons of good quality fish sauce, or anchovy paste to the sauce. Even if you think you hate anchovy, the best NY and NH pizzerias add this. Again, don\u2019t overdo it. Also add some good quality Italian Romano or Parmesan. I also add red pepper flake and garlic powder.\nHeat: use the highest oven temp you can get. My oven gets to 500F, and I preheat at least 20 minutes. If you\u2019re using a stone, preheat that at least 30 minutes.\nUse full fat cheese. Part skim isn\u2019t as good.\nIf you use sausage, don\u2019t use supermarket packaged sausage if you can help it. If you have an ethnic deli close to you, get your sausage there. Some supers carry good quality sausage, but it can be hit or miss.\nGood luck.\nQ: Why does homemade pizza never taste the same as pizza from a restaurant?

Your best bet would be to use a pizza stone. Put it in the oven while it's preheating, and set the oven as high as it'll go. Give it an extra 10 or 15 minutes after it's pre-heated, just to make sure it's good and ripping hot. Then, use a pizza peel to transfer it onto the stone, or if you have oven gloves that can withstand the heat you can put the stone on a heat-safe surface for a minute to make the transfer a little easier.", "You will never quite match the restaurant recipe.\nI have made a lot of pizzas from scratch.

Most residential cooking devices don\u2019t have the capability to get hot enough to re-create the cooking environment that is used in restaurants. After that it comes down to crust, then sauce, then cheese. It can take hundreds of trial and errors to find the perfect home cooking ingredients to make a delicious tasting pizza at home. Also, it comes down to expectations; you have to accept that fact that home-made is just not going to live up to your restaurant expectations, it\u2019s just the way it is.", "The big difference I found is the cheese. Are you using whole milk or part skim. Many grocery stores do not sell whole milk mozzarella cheese. Not in small cities anyway. All the national brands are part skim. That makes a huge difference. I finally learned that some of the mozzarellas cheese sticks are whole milk cheese and I grate those.\nI use 00 flour for my pizza dough which is traditional Italian. I asked when I was in Italy a few years ago.\nIf you live in a big city maybe you can find low moisture whole milk mozzarellas. I live in a small city. Do not use whole milk fresh mozzarella or you will have a pool of water on your pizza.", "Maybe a bit of both. Check with reliable sources to compare your ingredients and methods against theirs. I recommend America's Test Kitchens, King Arthur Flour, and Google. While we all are at home, maybe you have time to call your favorite pizza maker and have a discussion about how they make pizza and what special ingredients they use.", "If you\u2019re after that restaurant-style of crust and cheese, then your problem is, as others may have indicated, the heat, or lack thereof. Home ovens simply don\u2019t reach the temperatures needed to cook pizzas like commercial ovens do. You want very high temps that allow for very fast cooking, and when you\u2019re baking at 350, that doesn\u2019t really work.\nThere is salvation. What we started doing recently is using a mix of a pizza steel and a pizza stone. The steel sits on one rack, and the stone sits on the rack above it. We then turn the oven onto maximum temperature (500 degrees), for an hour, so that everything can heat up. We then place the pizza onto the steel using a pizza peel (a fancy paddle thingy). The pizza cooks completely in 10 - 12 minutes.\nSee, by doing this we create what amounts to an oven inside the oven. It concentrates and distributes the heat, and makes for a really tasty pizza that\u2019s got a crispy crust and golden cheese.\nOther tips: make your own crust and sauce. Both are easy to do, especially the sauce. Simply mix a small can of tomato paste with half a can of water (adjust as needed if you want your sauce thinner or thicker), mix in some basic pizza seasoning (oregano, basil, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, whatever), and some salt to taste. Also you\u2019ll probably want to use low moisture, whole milk mozzarella. That melts very well.\nSo get the steel and stone. Together they\u2019ll run you a bit under $100. Once you\u2019ve got those, experiment a bit, and you\u2019ll get the pizza you like. Enjoy!", "It all depends on the temperature of the oven. Those at home never reach temperatures high enough to cook pizza in 3/4 minutes, as it should.", "You are missing only the knowledge that homemade food is not supposed to always taste the same. That\u2019s the beauty of it. If you prepare your own food at home it comes out different each time.

Even the weather often makes your food different in a subtle way (or not so subtle whe we are talking about doughs).\nFood is an artisanal product, and the main quality of artisanal production is the fact that each item is slightly different from the other. Only industrially manufactured products are always exactly the same. This standardization introduced by industrialization is welcome in certain items (I am very glad to have a measuring stick that measures my centimeters and inches very exactly), but it\u2019s a defect in others.

Everything else which they add onto the bread have become extra for them. BUT here is where things changes. Overtime, the use of bread become less and less importance and the use of extras started to become more important to the point that it is bread that is an extra nowadays.\nOver the time, this developed into fast food like burgers, taco, steak etc where bread itself could be eliminated from the diet altogether.", "Completely different lifestyles and access to quick food.

How long did you cook the ham? It may need to be cooked longer, with additional liquid, in order to become tender in the first place. 300\u00b0F isn't excessively high. It's on the low side, I cook most meats at 350\u00b0. Collagen tissue is a big part of what makes meat tough. Collagen begins to melt at 180\u00b0F. Most people cook meat only to 160-165\u00b0F, the temperature at which it's considered safe, but that's not the optimum temperature to make it good. Higher internal temperatures make it tender, and develop the flavors more. You don't need or want a higher cooking temperature, you just have to give it more time. You can cook it at 200\u00b0f, and it will eventually reach an internal temp of 180\u00b0f.\nIf you use a meat thermometer, and cook a ham until it reaches an internal temperature of 180\u00b0F, and hold it there for at least 20 minutes, it will get tender, unless it really has dried out. Usually it hasn't. Ham contains a lot of salt, which tends to make it hold onto water.\nI'd put it back in the pan, add a couple of inches of water, put a lid on it, and stick it back in the oven for a couple of hours.\nIf this ham is already sliced, you might try simmering one or two slices for awhile, anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour, (don't let it boil dry) and see what happens.", "It will help tenderize it; this may also draw out the saltiness.

There are two other options that I have used with mixed success, but they do work once you get the timing down.\nYou can steam the ham, which works quite well the add water to it. If you have a steaming basket that you use for vegetables, just follow that same procedure with ham instead of veggies.\nThe other option is wrap a few slices in a moist paper towel and microwave it for 30 seconds or so.

What is wrong with you?\nIf you intended this as a joke, nice try, but they won\u2019t be laughing. They won\u2019t find this funny, in fact, you may want to run. Vegans take being vegan VERY seriously and it isn\u2019t something you should joke around with. As a vegan, if someone did this to me, they would no longer be friends with me. Period. The reason they take it so seriously is because they firmly believe in the rights of other creatures.\nYou obviously have two options: tell them or don\u2019t. If you tell them you risk losing them as a friend or losing their trust completely. If you don\u2019t tell them, they will go around unaware that they ever ate eggs and you will have to live with being the only one who knows. If I were in your shoes I would fess up and deal with it. If you tricked and manipulated your friend on purpose, do you deserve to have them as a friend?\nI\u2019ll give you a bit of an example from my personal experiences. I was on a trip wit my family last summer in Europe, and we were waiting at a train station for a train to take us further along our journey. We were hungry and my parents went down to find something to eat. They came back with focaccias, and I began to eat. I noticed after a few bites that there were odd long things on the top of the breads and asked my parents what they were. My parents are vegan and had purchased focaccias with salmon accidentally.\nI am scarred from that experience. It is something that will never leave my mind as long as I live. I threw up in the bathroom while crying for an hour. To this day, I have lost trust in everyone when it comes to food. If someone gives me something to eat, I won\u2019t eat it unless I am able to read the package\u2019s ingredient list or they show me what they put in it. Even though it was accidental, it is something that has scarred me and will never leave my mind.\nIn your case it is intentional. I don\u2019t want your friend to lose trust in all their other friends like I have. You have to make the choice of whether to tell them and risk the consequences or to not tell them and live with what you have done without being able to tell them.", "Dude wtf is wrong with you?

I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him but did wonder why he thought he had such a terrible allergy but had no effect when he ate my pizza they did have dairy in the sauce", "Yes. First because the only way I would ever do such a thing would be accidentally, and an apology would be absolutely necessary. And second, because many vegans become sensitive to animal proteins and fats after being vegan for a long time. There is a significant chance that this vegan will become sick, and it would be my responsibility to help them prepare for that possibility (so they\u2019re not caught by surprise in an unpleasant situation, like in the middle of taking the bus home from my theoretical dinner party) and to offer them whatever care I can while the illness passes.", "I wouldn\u2019t have fed it to them to begin with because I respect other humans and their dietary needs.\nIf you were aware, eggs are an animal product. I can not even begin to explain how annoying and difficult it is for people who are vegan to try to go out to eat, let alone trust others to understand their needs. Similar events happen to me all the time from both well meaning and mostly just people who are careless. And for the most part it\u2019s down right annoying, but it gets dangerous because people don\u2019t make a big deal about milk. I\u2019ve definitely asked for almond milk and received regular milk only to become crippled by pain.

Mom apologized, customer apologized and dinner moved forward.", "Would you tell a strict vegan that the dish they ate that you cooked\ncontained eggs in it (after they had finished it all and said it was\nnice)?\nThere is no such thing as a strict vegan. Either you are vegan, or you are not. A strict vegetarian is a vegan. A vegan that makes exceptions is plant-based.\nOther than that, you seem to assume vegans are vegans because they \u201cdon\u2019t like\u201d animal products. No. Vegans are vegans because they don\u2019t want to cause harm to or exploitation of animals. While many vegans do end up thinking animal products are disgusting and not food, that is not the driving force and plenty of vegans never think that. Egg is often used as a binder or emulsifier and cannot be detected in many instances, hence the majority of meat eaters cannot tell if a cake is vegan (when it is well-made).\nSo if you intentionally serve a vegan something with eggs in, and they like it, you\u2019ve proved nothing, and if you tell them afterwards, you\u2019ll just make them feel sick and no longer consider you a friend. You\u2019ll also teach them a lesson in not trusting people and make them more likely to not eat anyone else\u2019s food in future. You also never know if someone really liked a dish you prepared or if they are just being polite, so keep that in mind. If you don\u2019t tell them but tell your mutual friends, and they all start doing it, you are just all many levels of stupid and disrespectful and the only thing you will prove is that. Additionally, some vegans end up reacting to food they have not eaten for an extended period, in which case you\u2019d be poisoning them.\nIf a person is not allergic and not avoiding certain foods on moral or religious grounds, it may be justified to serve them food they think they don\u2019t like to remove their mental block, but this should be done with caution as what makes sense to you may not make sense to another person. For example, someone might like curry and pineapple, but still feel literally sick if there\u2019s pineapple in curry because they can\u2019t stand the mixture of sweet and savoury. So, it\u2019s a complicated matter and unless you know someone extremely well, to be avoided with the possible exception of someone saying they don\u2019t like x because it doesn\u2019t contain y when the difference is non-existent or negligible, and they have not tried it.\nSo to sum up, veganism has nothing to do with \u201cnot liking\u201d something, so force-feeding a vegan said ingredients just makes you an idiot. On the other hand, not telling a person x ingredient is in or not in something in order to encourage them to try it, when you know for certain they are not allergic or opposed to said ingredient on moral grounds and you are both well-meaning and have compelling reasons to assume they would actually like it, may be acceptable in some situations.", "Gods, no, what kind of asshole would do that?", "No, please be further kind to that person.

The reason is either or both ethical and health reasons. Eggs have large amounts of deadly ingredients; especially cholesterol. If that were done to us, we would cross that person off our list and NEVER associate with them again. It is an affront and a vile thing to do.

For others, violating dietary laws is an emotional shock which threatens their stability, and which can destroy their sense of self-worth.\nDeliberately making someone violate their dietary practices or rules or laws is one of the most cruel and thoughtless acts you could do.

You must never be in a position where you are debating whether to tell someone what you have done to \u201cget around\u201d his dietary practices.\nNot only are you absolutely forbidden and prohibited from intentionally (but \u201cin secret\u201d) making them violate their dietary practices, you must take care at all times to assure the you are not accidentally defiling them, or poisoning them. You have to ask people, in advance of preparing or ordering any foods, whether they have any dietary limitations or regulations \u2014 for any reason, not just allergies and religious beliefs. Alcoholism and drug intolerance being only two of many other problems.\nYou must make certain that anything you serve is fully in accord with everyone\u2019s restrictions \u2014 even if that means some of your guests must also be subjected to the same limitations, which ordinarily would not apply to them.\nTime to grow up.

Boiling is the point at which the pressure of steam of hot liquid. e.g. water, equals the pressure of the environment and the bubbles of foam appers inside the liquid. At that moment the temperature of a pure liquid usually stops rising, as the production of steam uses heat as fast as it is supplied to the liquid. However any mixtures or bodies containing water, as most of the foods, may be heated to the higher temperatures that the boiling point of water.\nUnder lower pressure the boiling point is lower, under higher pressure it is higher. That\u2019s why it is sometimes difficult to cook at the high altitudes, and why cooking in a pressure cooker is faster that in a normal pot.\nFood may be cooked in the various temperature, lower, even, or higher than 100\u00b0C. The chemistry and physics of cooking various foods embrace many processes, not necessarilly conected with the evaporating of water.\nIn the lower temperatures cooking processes may last longer and not all of them may properly or at all.", "While some of your details are incorrect, your thinking is absolutely correct. What you are describing is well known to any barbecue pitmaster. It even has a name \u201cthe stall\u201d. When water evaporates, it takes a good deal of heat away with it. During low temperature cooking around 105 degrees C, evaporative cooling will keep meat at a temperature significantly below the ambient cooking temp. Large pieces of meat with large surface areas for evaporation like brisket can stay stuck at the stall for hours. Eventually as the water evaporates and leaves the meat the rate of cooling slows down and the temperature will begin to rise again.\nWhat Is The Barbecue Stall, How Does It Help Create \"Bark,\" And How Do I Beat The Stall?", "It\u2019s tempting to think that if you are patient you could bake food at a lower temperature for a longer time and get the same result. The reason this is not true in practice is that there are OTHER processes going on when you cook in an oven besides just \u201cgetting hot\u201d.\nFor one, water is evaporating from the food (even at temperatures well below 100C), and the longer it cooks, the more water is lost. That is, if you heat a food slowly you will lose more water than if you heat it quickly. Sometimes this is a good thing. For example beef jerky is made in an oven set well below the boiling point because the goal is to reduce moisture.\nBut for other foods, losing more water is a bad thing. For example, a lasagna would likely get very dry cooked long and slow even if you covered it. And a chicken breast would be even worse.\nIn addition, some recipes require that the outside of the food become much hotter than the inside. For example, consider an apple pie. Cooked at 110C the top crust of an apple pie would not brown, and instead would be mushy and soggy as the vapors from the gradually cooking interior saturated it.\nIn summary, if you want the food in your oven to turn out right, you need to cook it at the right temperature.", "Water evaporates below 100 C. Just think of what happens if you leave water in a dish on your counter. Over the course of a couple of days, that water will disappear because it has evaporated into the air.\nWhat happens at 100 C is water reaches its boiling point (at standard pressure\u2026for you technically correct folks). Below 100C, as heat entering the water body from a hot oven, for instance, both raises the temperature and evaporates some of the water. At 100C all heat that goes into the water is used to evaporate the water.\nIm sorry to say that your last statement is gobbledegook to me. I\u2019ll try to interpret it and provide an explanation based on my interpretation.\nI think you are asking if an oven at 200C will cook as fast as an oven at 300C, because the food is limited to 100C by the boiling point of water. If that is your question, the answer is again \u201cno\u201d. Here\u2019s why.\nThe rate of heat moving between two bodies is determined to a large part by the temperature difference between them. In engineering we call it the \u201cdelta T\u201d, which is the temperature of item 2 minus the temperature of item 1, or T2-T1. In the example i gave, the delta T of the 200C oven is half that of the 300C oven. The food should cook approximately faster as heat enters the 100C item twice as fast. That\u2019s why the chicken you roast at 400F looks different and cooks faster than the chicken you bake at 350F.\nAs an example if you grab a piece of metal that was in boiling water, you\u2019ll get a bit of a scald and maybe a bit of a sunburn type of burn (your skin is damaged in a couple of seconds by exposure to 60C, but it\u2019s the proteins and fats, not the water). If you put that same piece of metal in a 300 C oven and grab it you\u2019ll get a nasty burn. It might not even flake off like a sunburn, but instead sear your hand like the meat it is. Please don\u2019t do either!", "No! water evaporates at at any temperature above -273 degrees Celsius. , What happens is that a molecule escapes the surface and floats away. This reduces the temperature of the remaining water a little. Then if a water molecule falls into the surface, it bonds, and increases the temperature a little. The probability of these events happening depends on the temperature ,as at higher temperatures , more molecules can break away. At 100 degrees Celsius, the amount of water vapour in the space above the surface, can equal atmospheric pressure and boiling takes place. .. bubbles of vapour firm anywhere in the water column , not only at the surface can force their way out.

Capellini\nCapellini, or more commonly known as angel hair pasta, is one of the thinnest types of pasta with a diameter ranging between 0.85 and 0.92 millimeters.\n2. Fettuccine\nFlat, ribbon-like shape of fettuccine makes it a sturdy pasta that can hold up to a variety of sauces. It\u2019s best known; however, for the popular dish fettuccine alfredo.\n3.Farfalle\nThe fun shape of this pasta earned it its nickname \u201cbow tie pasta.\u201d Farfalle is a versatile pasta shape that can be used in most recipes that call for a short pasta. It pairs particularly well with meat and vegetable dishes.\n4.Fusilli\nFusilli gives any dish an unexpected twist with its spiral shape. These short noodles pair well with nearly any sauce, but they also make great summer pasta salads that you can bring on a picnic or to the neighborhood potluck.\n5. Linguine\nLong, thin, flat linguine noodles fall somewhere between the thickness of fettuccine and spaghetti. Linguine is best known for its ability to compliment clam-based sauces and other seafood dishes.\n6.Macaroni\nEveryone knows this kid-favorite pasta. Whether it\u2019s homemade or from a box, macaroni and cheese is a crowd-pleaser. The tube-shape of macaroni pasta is perfect for cream sauces or anything with melty cheese.\n7. Orecchiette\nOrecchiette translates to \u201clittle ears\u201d because the pasta\u2019s concave shape resembles an ear. The indent picks up vegetables or whatever else it\u2019s paired with, making it a great carrier of stronger flavors.\n8.Pappardelle\nPappardelle noodles are similar to fettuccine in that they\u2019re flat, but pappardelle is wider than fettuccine.\n9.Penne\nPenne is a classic pasta type and pantry staple. The short, tube-shape and hollow center makes it suitable for all sorts of sauces and pairings, from chunky meat sauces to delicate creams.\n10. Speghetti\nSpaghetti is one of the most, if not the most, well-known types of pasta.\nThanks\nCourtesy Google", "Each pasta is made in different shapes &different methods ,ingredients they all have a different texture &taste", "There are many shapes of pasta. Around 600 long, small and curled in different designs. Ever there are endless number of stuff pastas.\nChefs use different shapes and sizes of pasta for different purposes because certain shapes hold different sauces better than others. Thin pasta, such as angel hair works better with thin oil-based sauce, while thicker sauces work better with thicker, heavier pastas.", "Whilst there may be pasta shapes designed to be decorative rather than functional most pasta shapes serve a clear purpose. Spaghetti, for example, holds a pesto or a finely ground beef sauce very well, whereas if you used a thicker pasta noodle for something like pesto or just a simple olive oil and garlic dressing there would be too much pasta per forkful to flavoring. Yet a thick tagliatelle would be very suited to a game pasta sauce made with chunks of rabbit or hare. Chunky vegetable sauces work very well with large pasta shells, as the shells catch the vegetable pieces in the sauce, making it easier to eat. Tubular pasta works very well with creamy sauces (such as macaroni and cheese) because it is very satisfying to bite into the tube and feel the sauce releases within. You could also say that so many shapes exist to satisfy the individual's personal taste and sense of fun.\nyou can find different types of pasta\u2019s below,\nList of pasta - Wikipedia"], "topic_list": ["Spaghetti", "Pasta", "Italian Food and Cuisine", "Shapes", "Geology", "Recipes", "Geometry", "Cooking", "Mathematics", "Food"], "view_list": [363, 40, 104, 107], "create_time": "Apr 14, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Gaurav More", "upvote_list": [2, 0, 1, 0], "question_title": "What kind of shapes does pasta come with?
