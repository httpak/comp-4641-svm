This is THE biggest problem we face with nutrition that, once assimilated into our brains as \u201cfact\u201d, becomes nigh impossible to topple. Before you get defensive, let me explain.\nSIDE RANT\nHave you ever seen someone get terrible news? Their first reaction, is of course, denial. Last week, I had a horrible dream where my husband (an ICU / CC nurse working with Covid19 patients) died, alone. I remember my reaction in the dream: I shouted \u201cnoooo\u201d for about a zillion hours as I sobbed. Humans are plagued by the concept of \u201chope\u201d and once we incorporate something into our reality, whether it\u2019s a stupid conspiracy, anti-vaccination, anti-climate change, anti-anything \u201cdogmatic\u201d, our brains re-adjust that idea and incorporate it into our perception of self. We go from thinking it is true to HOPING it is true. Hoping for something to be true clouds judgment and we begin to force it to be true (whether it can be true or not) through denial, violence and shouting. Once something contradicts a paradigm (our world, our family, our beliefs, etc.), our brain has to reconcile it and sometimes, that is through persistent denial.\nWhat are your beliefs? Big and small, you associate those with the \u201cself\u201d. Are you a born again Christian? More than just an idea, right? It\u2019s a whole part of your being. Religious people like to think this is ONLY true of their faith, but sadly, it\u2019s true of all beliefs. Once we incorporate a belief as a central part of our identity, we will defend that belief \u2014even when it\u2019s manifestly wrong\u2014 to our own doom, if such a case arrives. We see this with the sad comedic morons who are the laughing stock of humanity: flat earthers. One such mentally infirm idiot just killed himself and that wasn\u2019t even a religion, it was some weird conspiracy about the curvature of the planet.\nWhat are you dogmatic beliefs? What would it take for you to change your mind? If you don\u2019t know that, figure it out. Challenge yourself and say, \u201cHow can I prove my previous axiomatic belief wrong?\u201d If you don\u2019t do that, that\u2019s not bad, it just means you\u2019re admitting that it\u2019s dogma and not a simple statement of belief. I believe aliens exist on other worlds, but that\u2019s such an unfounded belief, I would dispense with it casually as I will any belief I hold about anything in existence.\n/Side Rant\nDon\u2019t be that way.\nNo single item of food on planet Earth has a one-off metric of \u201chealth\u201d. Nothing. You need fat, but if you only eat fat, you die. You need water, but too much water will drown you. It\u2019s about the nexus point of quantity and quality over time factored against all sorts of things like your general health, sex, weight, physical exercise, age, etc. A single Snickers bar is no more unhealthy than a King Sized Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter cup. What matters is how frequently you eat it over time when judged against your caloric needs, health, weight, etc. A burger once every two weeks? Totally fine. Your body possesses the ability to process that stuff out the body, retrieve its vast amount of nutrients and get rid of the salt and calories you do not want. But if you did that daily, you\u2019d probably overwhelm that system and slowly accumulate all kinds of problems like obesity.\nPeople who like the slippery slope approach to nutrition are idiots and have no clue how physiology or nutrition works. \u201cWell, the way I figure the health quality of a food is by asking myself, \u2018if I eat this regularly, will it hurt me?\u2019\u201d which is the most idiotic way of thinking. YOUR DIET IS BASED ON VARIETY and asking yourself what it would be like if you did X every day fails the reality test \u2014 that isn\u2019t going to happen and if it did, even with healthy things, you die the same death as if you starve or eat yourself to death \u2014 deas is mother fucking dead. Sure, avoid eating whatever you like it\u2019s your body. But that isn\u2019t science. Every food item, when applied to the \u201cslippery slope fallacy\u201d becomes unhealthy. Anything in existence when taken too far, is unhealthy. Eat a candy bar once in a while. No single candy bar is healthier than the other. Yes, some carry more calories and if \u201ccalories = unhealthy\u201d to you, then don\u2019t eat the king-sized ones or, if it bothers you that much, don\u2019t eat them at all.", "rat intestine"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Vita Lea", "view_list": [4, 773, 16]}, "220": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Paula Burgette"], "question_title": "Why don't bananas grow straight?", "topic_list": ["Bananas", "Fruit", "Food"], "no_of_view": "1,758", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [1], "ans_list": ["Probably because they don\u2019t have woody stems and so the weight from their leaves and eventual fruit makes them grow at an angle and sag."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Don Culanag", "view_list": [27]}, "26": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Brenda Lumpp"], "question_title": "What time does the dinner menu start at Golden Corral?", "topic_list": ["Golden Corral", "Buffets", "Dinner", "Food"], "no_of_view": "300", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["There is no longer a breakfast buffet and a dinner buffet.

Antalya food\nthere are a few unique cases about the innovation of Buffalo wings. One of the cases is that Buffalo wings were first arranged at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York, by Teressa Bellissimo, who claimed the bar with spouse Frank in 1964. At the time chicken wings were modest and unfortunate, fundamentally being utilized for stock or soup.The chicken wings utilized for Buffalo wings are typically portioned into three sections: drumette, level, and flapper or pointer, the remainder of which is disposed of. Customarily, the wings are pan fried in oil, without breading or flour until they are very much cooked.\nThen again, they might be heated, barbecued, or broiled.Cayenne pepper, hot sauce and liquefied spread or margarine are the base of the Buffalo wing sauce, which might be made gentle, medium, or hot. Commercial prepared to-utilize wing sauce is made with differing levels of spiciness. The cooked chicken wings are put in a bowl or pot and shaken to cover the wings totally covering them in sauce before serving.Traditionally, Buffalo wings are presented with little sticks of celery (went with some of the time with child carrots or carrots cut julienne), and blue cheddar plunging sauce as an afterthought.

Rabbits are like horses, and if they get too many carbs they will bloat and colic and die a horrible death.

Stevia is considered to be non-caloric, meaning that it has zero calories. This nonexistent calorie count makes stevia a very healthy sugar alternative for people with diabetes\nand those who are managing their weight or are on a weight-loss journey.\nResearch has shown that stevia sweeteners\ndon't contribute any calories or carbs to the diet, and have no effect on blood glucose and insulin. This research has been helpful for those with diabetes and allows them to eat a wider variety of foods while using stevia as a substitute for sugar. Not only is stevia a healthy choice for people with diabetes, but also for those who are watching their weight. Did you know that the intake of sugars has been shown to contribute an average of 16 percent of the total calories in the American diet? This has been linked to weight gain and reduced control of blood glucose levels.

Sterols are steroid alcohols and are an important class of organic molecules that occur naturally in plants. They are linked to reduced LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) levels in our bodies. Kaempferol\nis a strong antioxidant that helps to prevent oxidative damage to our cells, lipids, and DNA. Studies have also confirmed that kaempferol acts as a chemopreventive agent, which means that it inhibits the formation of cancer cells. Which is great news for pancreatic cancer patients those at risk of being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer? One study, in particular, has shown that kaempferol can reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer by 23 percent! That's a big deal!\nNot only does stevia have plenty of health benefits\n, but it is also very beneficial to your skin! Studies have shown that stevia prevents wrinkles, halts the signs of aging, reduces acne, fights dermatitis or eczema, and revitalizes the skin! The intake of normal table sugar causes glycation, in which sugar binds to the collagen in our skin and makes it become stiff and brittle. By switching to stevia, you are not only stopping the process of glycation and keeping the collagen from breaking, but it's also rich in antioxidants that protect our cells from free radicals.

In fact, popular powdered stevia sweeteners go through dozens of steps during processing from bleaching to chemical alteration\n.\nThere are two compounds in stevia that are responsible for the sweetness: Stevioside and Rebaudioside A.\nRebaudioside A is most often extracted and used in stevia powders and sweeteners, but it is not usually the only ingredient. In fact, most stevia sweeteners on the market contain added erythritol from corn, dextrose or other artificial sweeteners.\nStevioside only makes up about 10% of the sweetness in stevia but also has the unusual bitter aftertaste that many people don\u2019t like in stevia.

You can use stevia to replace sugar in baking. With stevia, a little goes a long way. It is reportedly 100-300 times sweeter than table sugar.\nSounds too sweet to be true.\nLet\u2019s look more into the benefits of this natural sweetener.\n\u201cAlthough Stevia can be helpful to anyone, there are certain groups who are more likely to benefit from its remarkable sweetening potential. These include diabetic patients, those interested in decreasing caloric intake, and children. Stevia is a small perennial shrub that has been used for centuries as a bio-sweetener and for other medicinal uses such as to lower blood sugar,\u201d according to the National Institutes for Health\n(NIH).\nA 2010 study by the NIH found evidence that stevia lowered glucose and insulin levels in both lean and obese people. Recently, researchers\nexplained in some detail how stevia controls blood sugar levels. Study participants also reported to feel full and satisfied despite a low calorie intake.\nIn addition to this, a 2009 study\nsuggests stevia may help lower cholesterol.\n\u201cResults of intervention revealed that stevia extract intervention had positive and encouraging effects over lipid profile. No adverse effect was observed on the health status of the subjects and it can thus be concluded that the stevia extract intervention is effective in lowering the elevated levels of serum cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein levels and increasing the HDL levels,\u201d according to study notes.\nIn addition to this, several studies report stevia is rich in anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants that may help prevent cancer. It may even have antimicrobial properties and help fight bad bugs and infection.\nJust because a substance is natural does not mean it is safe. And there are some reported downsides to stevia.\nMost importantly, you have to be mindful of what stevia products you buy. Not all of them are created equal. Truvia, for example, has been reported to be chemically processed. Other stevia products may have sugar mixed in them in order to help mitigate some of the bitterness of natural stevia. So it\u2019s important to look for \u201c100 percent pure stevia extract\u201d on the label, not \u201cstevia powder.\u201d To learn more about additives often added to many stevia products on the market, click here\n.\nThere is also an NIH report\nthat suggested stevia may inhibit the growth of good bacteria in the gut.\nStevia may also interact with medications you may be taking, particularly medications you may be taking for diabetes, blood pressure and cancer. Talk to your doctor if you have any health issues and are interested in adding stevia to your diet.\nAt the end of the day, if you do use stevia it is probably a good idea to consume it in moderation.\nRemember, a little goes a long way.\nSource: Name Your Sweetener.

The BBC research tested stevia against aspartame but was not large enough to give a definitive answer.

The basic rations usually included:\nDried fish (protein, sodium and fat)\nSmoked sausage (for more protein, sodium and fat, a bit more like a luxury)\nNot less than 400 grams of rye bread (carbohydrate)\nShchi (\u0449\u0438), which means cabbage soup. (Vitamins and minerals, surely not that appetizing and colorful)\nIf the field kitchen units were responsible for a meal to a battalion or division, and food supply was not that harsh, there would be like these:\nKasha (\u043a\u0430\u0448\u0430), which means porridge. (barley, buckwheat or oat)\nKulesh (\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0448), millet porridge with vegetables (again, not that colorful)\nBorshch (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0449)\nTushonka (\u0442\u0443\u0448\u0451\u043d\u043a\u0430), canned stewed meat (beef and pork for most of the time), they were eaten with boiled potatoes, buckwheat kasha or bread as sandwich.\nSometimes, soldiers were served with hot tea from a samovar (\u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440).\nFor the pilots of the air force, their rations were far more better than most Soviet soldiers and provided more energy. They had all items that an ordinary infantryman received for rations, and items that an infantryman would seldom have, including fresh or dried fruit, fresh or condensed milk, cottage cheese, sour cream, eggs, butter and cheese.\nFor the navy personnel, as they could seldom get fresh vegetables and meat, they relied on fermented vegetables, pickles, raw onions for minerals and vitamins (to prevent scurvy), canned meat like corned beef, pork, fish for protein. For vessels, they had ovens to bake fresh breads and some had stoves for real dishes. For submariners, they relied on Rusks (twice-baked bread) for carbohydrate (to save oxygen from cooking inside a submarine). Red wine and cottage cheese would also be served for submariners as their great casualty rate (> 80%) for the well-being of mother Russia deserved better food for them.\nWell\u2026\u2026..this war was famous for its extreme brutality, so food mentioned above could all be luxuriant in some battles, like the Siege of Leningrad and Battle of Stalingrad.\nRye bread looks like this was already incredibly good in Leningrad\nFor more detail of the worst situation of food supply in Leningrad, watch this video:\nThe Great Patriotic War. Leningrad. Episode 5. StarMedia. Docudrama. English Subtitles (15:57\u201316:47)\nA soldier fought for Leningrad could only received less than 300 grams of bread per day, which the bread was made of burnt flour, food cellulose (sawdust) from wood processing and banknotes making, stale bran and a tiny proportion of fresh flour.\nDuring the Battle of Stalingrad, the supply line was exposed to German artillery and Stuka\u2019s bombardment, making the supply to Stalingrad very difficult. Small planes were counted on for dropping supply at nights, food was surely inadequate for all Soviet troops. A commissar had no difference on the amount of food received either, some of them traded their watches and luxuries for a long smoked sausage or a loaf of rye bread (equals a 10-day ration for several soldiers). Still, these brave men managed to defeat the 6th Army with extreme hunger and tiredness.\nIn other regions, Soviet soldiers who did not want to wait for supply would attack the German supply convoy and rob the German rations to cure hungers. Of course, it was never a sustainable way to feed the entire Soviet Army. Since October 1941, Lend-Lease Program began the US deliveries to the Soviet Union, including food. Finally, Stalin had adequate food to feed his massive army. (Actually, the amount of food sent from the US wasn't enough until early 1943 as the US had to figure out ways to minimize the destruction against the Arctic convoy by Germans, the establishment of another supply route, as well as the analysis on the strategic value of supply to USSR.)\nCanned food, chocolate bars and boxes with beverage powders not only filled soldiers\u2019 stomachs, but also morale for combat.\nC rations were also on the list\nBut perhaps the most famous food for the Soviets was this:\nSPAM!!!!!!!!! (luncheon meat)\nNikita Khrushchev declared: \"Without Spam we wouldn't have been able to feed our army.\" in his memoir. Just like the corned beef, Soviet soldiers loved to put it between two slices of bread to turn it into a sandwich.\nApart from black tea, coffee and cocoa powder that provided energy and acted as morale boosters, there was one more thing that every soldier loved to see and wanted it so bad that they would not hesitate to put their cigarettes aside for drinking just a sip of it, that is\u2026\u2026.\nVodka!!!!!! (I know it doesn't look appealing but picture of a vodka bottle from that era is hard to find\u2026)\nThe old brand of Russian vodka\u2026..I just can\u2019t find one with original brand name (\u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f) on it.\nTo fight alcoholism that might decrease combat effectiveness, soldiers were not given vodka for daily ration. Soldiers could only have a tiny shot (100 grams, for a Russian tough guy of course) before the battles or celebration of victory. Later, officers found that vodka was most useful on boosting troops\u2019 morale and they began to introduce vodka (100 grams) for better combat effectiveness. In the Battle of Stalingrad, bottles of vodka were packed into boxes with parachutes for light airplanes to carry for dropping onto the Soviet troops so that they could keep on fighting for more vodka and refuse to surrender, having great effect on turning low-morale troops into war heroes.\nLast but not least, soldiers needed their food cooked by cooks. Their contribution for defeating the Nazis should never be forgotten just like the heroes who picked up their rifles and put rains of leads to crush the enemies. Just like what Napoleon said: \u201can army marched on its stomach\u201d. Those army chefs showed their creativity on making dishes when the food supply ran low, they still managed to make food appealing, yummy and nutritious with the only ingredients that they could get. They might make mistakes from time to time, but we can\u2019t deny that those cooks really did their jobs for feeding the glorious Red Army during the Great Patriotic War.\nI think this is it for the answer.", "Anything they could find. Stalin\u2019s \u2018burnt/scorched earth\u2019 policy worked not only against the German army but the Soviet army as well.

I would imagine fish borscht which is beet soup and whatever they could scrounge.", "According to the article, \u201cWartime cuisine: What did Soviet soldiers eat during World War II?, Russian Kitchen, May 9, 2018 by Maria Afonina the soldiers ate a variety of food.\nField kitchens provided bread, groats, macaroni, 150g of meat, 100g of fish, sugar ,tea, salt, vegetables(potatoes, cabbage, beets, etc.)\nSoviet submariners and pilots received better rations, eggs, butter, fruit, etc. There was also a ration for cigarettes for most troops. The article mentions \u201crusks\u201d which were a type of biscuit. There was also a \u201cRzhevsky\u201d bread made from potatoes and then cooked with bran.\nThe Americans and other allies provided the Soviets with cornmeal.

Submariners also had special additions to their diet: red wine, sauerkraut, salted cucumbers and raw onions", "Recently I met article about food of German and Russian soldiers. To my surprise, quality and volume were almost similar with following difference: Russian food was more energetic and included fat, hot soups, etc. Though Germans had chocolate and biscuits, and consumed a lot of Pervetin (doping) and Shnaps (German low quality vodka) .\nAnother negative side for Germans and allies, was low level of personal hygiene, this was very noticeable in Stalingrad battle. Russians had the banya (kind of sauna) on regular basis: once a week with replacement of complete uniform, while Germans, Italians, Poles, French, Finnish, Romanians and other member of German coalition had it may be once a winter.", "Anything they could.

Credit: Sergey Baranov/RIA Novosti\n\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d This month marks 75 years since the United States launched its Lend-Lease program to supply the Allies with much-needed war materiel for the fight against Hitler.\nDownplayed by the Soviet Union, the program was of vital importance to the USSR\u2019s war effort, as even Marshal Zhukov later admitted.\nOn March 11, 1941, American President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Lend-Lease bill, which permitted the U.S. to supply its anti-Hitler coalition allies with materiel.\n\u2018And how much sheet steel they gave us!\u2019\n\"Now they say that the allies never helped us, but it can't be denied that the Americans gave us so many goods without which we wouldn't have been able to form our reserves and continue the war,\" Soviet General Georgy Zhukov said after the end of WWII.\n\"We didn\u2019t have explosives, gunpowder. We didn\u2019t have anything to charge our rifle cartridges with. The Americans really saved us with their gunpowder and explosives. And how much sheet steel they gave us! How could we have produced our tanks without American steel? But now they make it seem as if we had an abundance of all that. Without American trucks we wouldn\u2019t have had anything to pull our artillery with.\"\nA loan that became history\nRussian historian: Importance of Lend-Lease cannot be overestimated\nThe history of Lend-Lease began on May 15, 1940 when UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill asked Roosevelt to temporarily give Britain 40-50 old destroyers in exchange for British naval and air bases in the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe Americans remembered a law from 1892 in accordance with which the defense secretary can \"lease army property for a maximum of five years if the country does not need it.\" Based on this law a supply program was developed, which Roosevelt signed into law on March 11, 1941.\nAccording to the program, American materials \"destroyed, lost or used during the war were not subject to payment.\"\nWhat had to be paid for was the property that remained after the war and was used for civilian purposes.\n\u2018The common enemy \u2013 bloodthirsty Hitlerism\u2019\nSoviet leader Joseph Stalin decided to join Lend-Lease soon after Hitler's Germany invaded the USSR in June 1941.\nThe U.S., UK, and Canada supplied the USSR with some $130 billion worth of supplies during WWII. Source: Anatoly Garanin / RIA Novosti\n\"Your decision, Mr. President, to give the Soviet Union an interest-free credit of $1 billion in the form of materiel supplies and raw materials has been accepted by the Soviet government with heartfelt gratitude as urgent aid to the Soviet Union in its enormous and difficult fight against the common enemy \u2013 bloodthirsty Hitlerism,\" Stalin wrote to Roosevelt.\nThe first convoys with American goods were already being sent to the USSR by August 1941.\nShortly afterwards the Germans found out about the convoy routes, and the allies suffered great losses. During the war Nazi submarines and torpedoes sank about 80 cargo ships destined for the USSR.\nMore than 14,000 U.S. airplanes, 8,000 of which came from Alaska, were given to the Soviet Union in the course of the war.\nThe USSR received a total of 44,000 American jeeps, 375,883 cargo trucks, 8,071 tractors, and 12,700 tanks. Additionally, 1,541,590 blankets, 331,066 liters of alcohol, 15,417,000 pairs of army boots, 106,893 tons of cotton, 2,670,000 tons of petroleum products and 4,478,000 tons of food supplies made their way into the Soviet Union.\n\u2018The Russian government wants to hide the fact that it receives help from outside\u2019\nAnd yet, during the war the Soviet government diminished the role of foreign aid. This made U.S. Ambassador to the USSR William Standley indignant.\n75 years ago the U.S. signed a bill to provide its allies with vital goods. Source: RIA Novosti\n\"It seems that the Russian government wants to hide the fact that it receives help from outside.\nObviously it wants to ensure its people that the Red Army is fighting this war alone,\" he said during a press conference in March 1943.\n\"After stormy five-hour telephone talks the Russian censorship allowed Standley's text to be published,\" the BBC's Moscow correspondent Alexander Werth later recalled.\n\"The employees at the press department were angry. Chief censor Kozhemyako was white with rage putting his stamp on the telegram. His mother had died in Leningrad from hunger.\u201d\nMoscow exits list of world\u2019s top 100 most expensive cities\nAfter the end of WW II the U.S. asked countries to pay for the civilian supplies they received (steamboats, trucks, power plants). The U.S. believed that the USSR had to pay $1.3 billion, yet Soviet government officials said they could only pay $170 million.\nObviously, the U.S. did not accept these conditions, which led to talks in 1972 at which the two countries signed an agreement whereby the USSR was obliged to pay the U.S. $722 million by 2001.\nIn the course of the following year the Soviet Union paid $48 million, but due to the American Jackson-Vanik amendment the Soviet Union ceased the payments.\nThe amendment restricted trade with countries that impeded emigration and violated other human rights.\nOne of the reasons for Washington introducing the amendment was the USSR's refusal to let Jews out of the country.\nIn 1990 America and the Soviet Union returned to the talks. It was decided that by 2030 America would receive $674 million. A year later the USSR collapsed.\nBut in 1993 the Russian government announced its succession to the debts and soon paid for all the goods that the USSR had received in accordance with the Lend-Lease bill\u201d\u201d\u201d, Lend-Lease: How American supplies aided the USSR in its darkest hour\n.\nA full version is available in Russian\n.\n(All rights reserved by Rossiyskaya Gazeta).", "Beef.

It is like drawing yellow with a black background or brown on a white background. The yellow and brown \u2018pops\u2019. Certain foods have more umami, such as mushrooms, and these can be used to make foods \u2018pop\u2019.\nAnswer 2: There has been a lot of debate about umami. But scientists have now established that there are separate receptors in the tongue that detect umami. By that definition it is a separate taste.

As others have said, it will start to lose some of its natural flavor and aroma after time. Throw it out when it no longer smells the way you want your pepper to smell. It will still be safe to use, though.\nBut let\u2019s talk about the meaning of \u201cexpired.\u201d \u201cExpired\u201d actually has no meaning when it comes to food products. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t actually see the word \u201cexpired\u201d very often. You are more likely to see \u201cuse by\u201d or \u201cbest by.\u201d\nSo food doesn\u2019t \u201cexpire,\u201d and it certainly doesn\u2019t expire on a certain date. Do you think that can of corn on your shelf was okay for 364 days and became toxic on the 365th?\n\u201cUse\u201d or \u201cBest by\u201d dates (which are required by the government, regardless of whether the item is really perishable) are generally the producer\u2019s conservative estimate of when the item will still have retained its quality. That can of corn will still be pretty much the same as the day it was canned, and not mushy and discolored. That box of crackers won\u2019t be stale.\nBut let me say this loudly: those dates have very little to do with whether the food is SAFE to eat. That depends completely on whether the food was prepared properly (i.e. not contaminated during the production process) and stored properly. If you leave your milk on the counter for a week, it\u2019s going to be bad regardless of the date on the package. If the distributor didn\u2019t refrigerate it properly, it could be bad before the date. If you contaminate something by putting a dirty utensil in it (or cutting it on a dirty cutting board) and then put it back in the refrigerator, it may be bad before the \u201cexpiration\u201d date. On the other hand, food that is stored properly \u2014 properly sealed and refrigerated \u2014 can be safe to eat for much longer than the \u201cexpiration\u201d date. Anything that is \u201cshelf stable\u201d won\u2019t \u201cspoil\u201d \u2014 it will just decline in quality over time (that box of crackers could be stale, but it\u2019s not unsafe). People throw out tons of perfectly good food every year because they are needlessly worried about \u201cexpiration\u201d dates.\nFinally, \u201cbad\u201d can mean different things. It can mean \u201cthis no longer tastes good\u201d for a product that is still safe to consume. It can mean \u201cthis has been in the fridge too long and it doesn\u2019t smell good\u201d \u2014 that might or might not make you sick if you ate it. Generally speaking, if it doesn\u2019t smell good, don\u2019t eat it (why would you want to, anyway?). But there is another kind of bad: bad because it contains pathogens, like salmonella or listeria. Those, unfortunately, you cannot smell, and they have very little to do with how the food was stored and mostly to do with the fact that it was contaminated in the production process. That chicken in your fridge that smells bad doesn\u2019t have salmonella just from being there a long time. It\u2019s unlikely it smells bad because it has salmonella, but if it does have salmonella, it\u2019s because it had salmonella when you bought it.

If you are interested in healthy lifestyle you can follow me on Instagram - prashantkasumiya", "Because our ignorance they feel eggs are veg\nOn the spiritual path, there are several reasons why a person is recommended to be vegetarian. One primary reason is that we need to see the spiritual nature within all living beings, and that includes the animals and other creatures as well. Universal brotherhood means nonviolence to both humans and animals. It consists of understanding that animals also have souls. They are alive, conscious, and feel pain. And these are the indications of the presence of consciousness, which is the symptom of the soul. Even the Bible (Genesis 1.21; 1.24; 1.30; 2.7; and in many other places) refers to both animals and people as nefesh chayah, living souls. Those who eat meat, however, because of their desires to eat animals or see them as a source of food for one\u2019s stomach, are not so easily able to understand the spiritual nature of all beings. After all, if you know that all living entities are spiritual in essence, and that all living beings that are conscious show the symptoms of the soul within, then how can you kill them unnecessarily? Any living creature is also the same as we are in the respect that it is also a child of the same father, a part of the same Supreme Being. Thus, the killing of animals shows a great lack in spiritual awareness.\nMany portions of the Vedic literature describe how the Supreme Being is the maintainer of innumerable living entities, humans as well as the animals, and is alive in the heart of every living being. Only those with spiritual consciousness can see the same Supreme Being in His expansion as Supersoul within every creature. To be kind and spiritual toward humans and be a killer or enemy toward animals is not a balanced philosophy, and exhibits one\u2019s spiritual ignorance.\nThe next reason for being vegetarian is to consider the amount of fear and suffering that animals experience in the slaughter industry. There are countless stories of how in fear cows cry, scream, and sometimes fall down dead while inside or even before they are taken into the slaughter house. Or how the veins of dead pigs are so big that it shows they have practically exploded from the fear the pig felt and the adrenalin that was produced while it was being led to slaughter. This certainly causes an immense amount of violence to permeate the atmosphere, which goes out and falls back on us in some form. Furthermore, the adrenalin and fear in the animal also produces toxins which then permeate the body of these animals, which meat-eaters ingest. People who consume such things cannot help but be effected by it. It causes tensions within them individually, which then spreads in their relations with others.\nThe ancient Vedic text of the Manu-samhita (5.45-8) says, \u201cHe who injures innoxious beings from a wish to give himself pleasure never finds happiness, neither living nor dead. He who does not seek to cause the suffering of bonds and death to living creatures, but desires the good of all beings, obtains endless bliss. . . Meat can never be obtained without injury to living creatures, and injury to sentient beings is detrimental to the attainment of heavenly bliss; let him therefore shun the use of meat.\u201d\nThe Bible (Romans 14.21) also says, \u201cIt is neither good to eat flesh, nor to drink wine.\u201d Another biblical commandment (Exodus 23.5) instructs us to help animals in pain, even if they belong to an enemy.\nThe Buddhist scripture (Sutta-Nipata 393) also advises: \u201cLet him not destroy or cause to be destroyed any life at all, or sanction the acts of those who do so. Let him refrain from even hurting any creature, both those that are strong and those that tremble in the world.\u201d It is also said in the Buddhist scripture, the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, \u201cThe eating of meat extinguishes the seed of great compassion.\u201d\nFor Jews, the Talmud (Avodah Zorah 18B) forbids the association with hunters, not to mention engaging in hunting.\nIn the New Testament Jesus preferred mercy over sacrifice (Matthew 9.13; 12.7) and was opposed to the buying and selling of animals for sacrifice (Matthew 21.12-14; Mark 11.15; John 2.14-15). One of the missions of Jesus was to do away with animal sacrifice and cruelty to animals (Hebrews 10.5-10).\nWe especially find in Isaiah where Jesus scorns the slaughter and bloodshed of humans and animals. He declares (1.15) that God does not hear the prayers of animal killers: \u201cBut your iniquities have separated you and your God. And your sins have hid His face from you, so that He does not hear. For your hands are stained with blood. . . Their feet run to evil and they hasten to shed innocent blood. . . they know not the ways of peace.\u201d Isaiah also laments that he saw, \u201cJoy and merrymaking, slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine, as you thought, \u2018let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\u2019\u201d (22.13)\nIt is also established in the Bible (Isaiah 66.3), \u201cHe that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man.\u201d In this regard St. Basil (320-379 A.D.) taught, \u201cThe steam of meat darkens the light of the spirit. One can hardly have virtue if one enjoys meat meals and feasts.\u201d\nThus, we should find alternatives to killing animals to satisfy our appetites, especially when there are plenty of other healthy foods available. Otherwise, there must be reactions to such violence. We cannot expect peace in the world if we go on unnecessarily killing so many millions of animals for meat consumption or through abuse.\nThe third factor for being vegetarian is karma. As Newton's third law of motion states, for every action there must be an equal and opposite reaction. On the universal scale this is called the law of karma, meaning what goes around comes around. This affects every individual, as well as communities and countries. As the nation sows, so shall it reap. This is something we should take very seriously, especially in our attempt to bring peace, harmony, and unity into the world. If so much violence is produced by the killing of animals, where do you think the reactions to this violence goes? It comes back to us in so many ways, such as the form of neighborhood and community crime, and on up to world wars. Violence breeds violence. Therefore, this will continue unless we know how to change.\nIsaac Bashevis Singer, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature, asked, \u201cHow can we pray to God for mercy if we ourselves have no mercy? How can we speak of rights and justice if we take an innocent creature and shed its blood?\u201d He went on to say, \u201cI personally believe that as long as human beings will go shedding the blood of animals, there will never be any peace.\u201d\nIn conclusion, we can mention the March 10, 1966 issue of L\u2019Osservatore della Domenica, the Vatican weekly newspaper, in which Msgr. Ferdinando Lambruschini wrote: \u201cMan\u2019s conduct with regard to animals should be regulated by right reason, which prohibits the infliction of purposeless pain and suffering on them. To ill treat them, and make them suffer without reason, is an act of deplorable cruelty to be condemned from a Christian point of view. To make them suffer for one\u2019s own pleasure is an exhibition of sadism which every moralist must denounce.\u201d Eating animals for the pleasure of one\u2019s tongue when there are plenty of other foods available certainly fits into this form of sadism. It stands to reason that this is counterproductive to any peace and unity or spiritual progress we wish to make. It is one of the things we need to consider seriously if we want to improve ourselves or the world. So here are a few reasons why a genuinely spiritual person will choose to be vegetarian.", "Q: Why do many Indians who are vegetarian eat eggs, but not chicken or any other non vegetarian food?\nNo, egg is not a vegetarian product.

And in the matter of food vegetarianism stands in front of us.\nIn case of eggs because there is no killing of any animals so justification for eating of eggs is not much difficult.", "Most of the vegetarian Indians I know don't eat eggs, poultry, fish or other meat. For many, it is based on religious/spiritual principles of non-violence (i.e. not killing a living being). For others it is habit (what they were brought up with), underlined by these principles. For the latter group, as well as some in the former, eggs are acceptable because it does not involve the killing of chicken already alive.", "See Agony of Animal After Cutting It\n\n\nThe scripture says that the non-violence is the highest justice\n\n\nThe sin lies in the pain experienced by the animal or the bird in its death.\n\n\nThe word \u2018Maamsa\u2019 or mutton is derived like this \u201cAs this fellow (sa) kills me (Maam) now, I will kill him in the next birth\u201d.\n\n\nTo kill an innocent animal like deer for food, you are not a tiger or a lion staying in the natural forest following the natural set-up.

If you kill an innocent animal like goat/buffalo/chicken etc for your food, even though you have the option of the alternative vegetarian food, your attitude is proceeding in such a direction so that you will harm any innocent human being also for your enjoyment even though you have the alternative option for such enjoyment. This is more than sadism because a sadist enjoys by harming another person and he has no alternative person there for such enjoyment. If you analyze this subject through your sharp intelligence, you will find that the vegetarian food is far better than non-vegetarian food as per the medical science.\n\nThe proteins extracted by you from the plants in your vegetarian food are primary and are very good for health. The proteins taken by the animals from plants are re-synthesized in the body of the animal and such proteins are secondary only. The secondary proteins are not good for health. Therefore, as a student of science, you should act in every step after doing scientific analysis only. Apart from this, consider the path of sympathy, kindness and human compassion on seeing the agony of the bird or animal just after cutting it. If you do not give any consideration to these values and be cruel only, neither you are fit to study the science nor fit to study the arts having human values.\n\nGod came in human forms like Buddha and Mahaveera on this single programme only and preached the non-violence. Even though you do not participate in the killing of animal or bird, you become the due partner of the sin since the butcher is killing animals and birds to supply the mutton (meat) based on the demand of purchasers like you only. The scripture says that the non-violence is the highest justice (Ahimsaa paramo dharmah...). Even the plants have life but their mind is very primitive and hence the pain is very negligible compared to the birds, animals and human beings. Even in the case of plants, they are cut only after death, which ripens on losing the chlorophyll.\n\nParvati was called as Aparna because she did not even pluck the green leaves for her food during her penance. The sin is not in the non-vegetarian food, which is as good as vegetarian food, if you analyze the constituents like the common carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals etc. The sin lies only in the pain experienced by the animal or the bird in its death. Think a while that you are in its position and then discuss the subject. There is no sin in eating a naturally dead animal and a sect of Hindus called as Kapalikas do this and are not found fault for this. The word \u2018Maamsa\u2019 or mutton is derived like this \u201cAs this fellow (sa) kills me (Maam) now, I will kill him in the next birth\u201d. Based on this, you become the innocent goat and the innocent goat becomes the butcher in the next birth so that the pain is practically experienced by you.\nPlucking leaves and fruits is not killing. The crops are cut only when they die after loosing the sign of the life, which is the Green Chlorophyll. In plants life exists but mind and intelligence do not exist.\n\nLife is called as Pranamaya Kosa. Mind is Manomaya Kosa. Intelligence is Vijnanamaya Kosa. The life is only inert mechanism of exchange process of Oxygen and Carbondioxide and release of energy by oxidation. This mechanism has no awareness of the pain. The mind is represented by the nervous system, which is not present in the plants. The mind may be in very very primitive stage in plants as per the research of Mr. Bose. The ancient Indian sages avoided even plucking the leaves and fruits.\n\nThey ate leaves and fruits when they have fallen from the plants (Swayam Viseerna Dhruva Patra Vruttita). They avoided this trace of sin also. In plucking the leaf and killing an animal, the sin is qualitatively equal, but there is a lot of quantitative difference. One percent sin and hundred percent sin cannot be equated. Your argument concludes that if one does one percent sin, why not hundred percent sin be done? This equates to your statement that if one plucks a leaf why not we kill an animal.\n\nAre you pained equally if I steal one rupee(1 CENT) or one lakh rupees (1 MILLION $) from your pocket. The trace of sin can always be neglected. The Lord came as Bhuddha and preached this non-voilence. Veda also says that one should kill his animal nature in the sacrifice and not the animal (Manyuh Pasuh).", "Farmed eggs are almost always unfertilized, i.e. bear no embryo and have no chance of bearing life.

Produced in Japan and prized for its rich marbling and buttery taste, high-grade wagyu can cost up to $200 per pound, and the cows themselves can sell for as much as $30,000. But what is it that makes the meat so expensive?\nThe term wagyu literally translates to Japanese cow. And it generally refers to four main breeds. These cows were bred for physical endurance, giving them more intramuscular fat cells. The fat is distributed more evenly throughout their muscle, which is why wagyu beef looks pink and tastes so tender. And the Japanese government tightly regulates wagyu production to protect the value and quality of the meat.\nWagyu is graded on two main factors: how much meat can be yielded and the quality of the marbled fat. Only A3 to A5 wagyu is certified for sale in Japan. And the higher the grade, the higher the price. Wagyu beef has gained almost legendary status, and there are many myths about wagyu farms and the way the animals are treated, from getting daily massages to being fed beer. But these often aren't true.\nThe cows are raised very differently in each region and by different farmers, but they're often raised by a breeder until they're about 10 months old and then sold at auction to a fattening farmer. By the time the calves are sold at auction, they can already fetch 40 times the price of US cattle. The fattening farm will keep the animals in small pens and feed them a mixture of fiber and high-energy concentrate made from rice, wheat, and hay. They're often fed this three times a day for almost two years, until the animals are almost 50% fat. Only the pregnant cows and breeding cattle are allowed to graze on pasture.\nThe length of the fattening process and the import prices of the huge amount of concentrated feed increases the cost of the beef, and over this fattening period, each cow will eat 5 tons of feed. If and when a cow goes to auction, it can sell for as much as $30,000.\nComparatively, black Angus cattle, which are considered the cream of the crop in countries like the United States and Australia, typically don't sell for more than $3,000. And depending on the kind, the wagyu can fetch close to $200 per pound.\nHigh marbling is the common goal, but the approach varies by farm and area. While there are more than 300 varieties of wagyu available, the most notable cuts come from 10 regions. One of the most expensive cuts is Matsusaka wagyu from Mie Prefecture, made exclusively from virgin female cows and highly prized for its tenderness. In 2002, one Matsusaka cow sold for 50 million yen, or roughly $400,000. However, the best-known cut of wagyu is Kobe beef, which comes from the city of Kobe in Hyogo Prefecture and is made exclusively from steers, or castrated bulls.\nAlthough Kobe is commonly seen on US restaurant menus, customers should be wary of items like Kobe burgers, as authentic Kobe beef is too tender to be formed into a patty. Several US restaurants are actually serving hybrid \"wangus\" beef from domestically raised wagyu and Angus cows.\nThe highest-ranking wagyu is A5 Miyazaki, a two-time winner of the \"Wagyu Olympics.\" A5 Miyazaki will cost you $100 or more per pound. At SakaMai in New York City, it's the wagyu of choice. The restaurant is best known for serving it in an $85 katsu sando, a popular Japanese-style sandwich.\nKen: On a busy night, we probably serve about 25 of them at $85 a pop. Because wagyu is so difficult to find in the US, yes, we do have a number of customers coming to us just to try the wagyu. Sometimes a two-top will come and just order the sando by itself. There are a lot of tariffs and quotas on Japanese beef imports, and it's actually not allowed to import live cattle. So it is very difficult to source wagyu."], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020"], "question_author": "Vita Lea", "view_list": [15]}, "446": {"no_of_follower": 3, "respond_collected": 7, "name_list": ["Lewis Dynan", "Lonnie Moore", "Aaron Hefferin", "Michael Georgiades", "Ben Robinson", "Jan Gillard", "Mark Roberts"], "question_title": "What if I only have an oven that goes as up as 250\u00b0C but my recipe needs 350\u00b0? :/ can it still cook it?

Again, the big problem with coronavirus is that you can spread it for up to 4 days before you show symptoms and for up to 14 if you\u2019re a carrier, but asymptomatic.\nIf you re-open, you have to be pretty much 100% sure that all the workers test negative, and given the scarcity of tests, that\u2019s a pretty big order.\nAnd if one of those workers gets the virus from another source, we go through this all again.\nOne of the big problems is that plants like this are just tremendous opportunities for the virus to spread. Workers share cramped locker rooms and eating areas where social distancing is impossible.\nTo show you how big the problem is, both the Iowa plant and a similar plant in South Dakota are responsible for half the coronavirus cases in their respective states. That\u2019s most likely because one infected worker came in. A \u201csuperspreader\u201d who has the opportunity to be in a crowded environment can cause dozens, hundreds or thousands of cases.

Doesn\u2019t matter if Trump does it its wrong.\nThe best I think of is that CNN, Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the opposition will claim that he is sacrificing the lives of the employees who work there to get votes while ignoring the need to keep the food supply open. After thinking about this some more, I\u2019m guessing MSNBC, CNN and the rest will make some sort of claim about ensuring the supply of KFC fried chicken and Big Macs remain open.\nYou know what really baffles me? This guy Trump is doing exactly what needs to be done. He\u2019s supplementing the income of average Americans, providing keep open funds to small businesses, he\u2019s pumping up the money supply while the nation is closed down, its putting out plans for a staggered reopening. Yet no matter what he or the administration does the universal claim is that its the wrong thing.\nEqually baffling, something I personally was astounded by when it was revealed, is not only ignored by the media, the very very very little coverage it got is completely excused under the label of \u2026\u2026\u2026 Well I really don\u2019t know how you excuse this because it appears to be to be administrative murder of the elderly and handicapped.\nMarch 25th, NYS followed immediately by NJ issued a directive mandating that nursing homes readmit Covid positive patients into their nursing homes while simultaneously ordering that no one other than employees could enter the nursing homes. The state directive barred the patients families from even checking on them. Covid spread like wildfire and the patients died en masse.\nThe result was that 30 per cent (it may be close to 50 percent now) of all Covid fatalities were nursing home patients. There was so many deaths the bodies were being stored in nursing home outdoor sheds. This occurred at the exact same time that the NYS governor had the bald faced nerve to claim that the protection of elderly nursing home patients was a NYS priority.\nWhen the governor was finally asked about this about two weeks later, during one of his daily press conference he stated that he was fully behind the directive. Did that result in media outrage? No it did not. Other democratic contingent outrage? No it did not. Did it result in media condemnation? No it did not. Was he even criticized by the media? Not to my knowledge other than by a couple of rabid radical, insane extremist right wing pundits. Wow. These are the same people who are always claiming that the elderly, the dementia population, the disabled have to be a priority in any enlightened progressive and moral administration. But not this time.\nWhat is equally troubling\u2026. Well not equally but troubling (again, at least to me) are the comments by other Quora members. I\u2019m unaware of any of them that have not supported this directive and claimed that there just wasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t any choice but to put those Covid positive patients right into those nursing homes - no other place to put them. Of course there was and there is.\nYou know this whole thing really Is an inexcusable immoral disgrace but on the theory that an immoral disgrace isn\u2019t a disgrace at all if no one talks about it, the media will not cover it.

This subject could be veeery long, but I\u2019ll try to keep a focus on food.\nPeople can live without eating meat; in fact, vegetarianism may be a healthier lifestyle.\nIt seems that die-hard meat eaters would think twice about eating food handled by workers who are ill with COVID-19. (Yeah, yeah, I know there\u2019s no evidence that the virus spreads through the consumption of food, but who knows? I do know \u201cevidence,\u201d in many cases, is just a contraction for \u201cever I\u2019m dense.\u201d)\nIt seems that any human would think twice about continuing a lifestyle that plainly advertises this attitude: Gimme my burgers! If people die producing meat, then others can be hired. Especially right now, haw-haw.\nIn other words, we should be supporting people; not dead meat.\nThis would result in support for living animals, as opposed to the current drooling over pieces of dead ones.\nThe growing of more vegetables, and fewer animals for consumption, is better for the environment, so this would help us heal our planet from the ravages of climate change. (Yeah, yeah, I know: Climate change is a deep state plot, invented by China, spurred on by the do-nothing Dems \u2014 and I don\u2019t believe any of that.)\nOK, in an effort to keep this somewhat short, I\u2019ll just say, I\u2019m not a vegetarian. I dislike the taste of any meat, and the very the idea of eating it is sickening. That means I eat very little of it, and I have to turn off my brain when I do so. I\u2019d like to be a vegetarian, but haven\u2019t made the commitment yet.\nPerhaps I\u2019ll finally make the commitment, though, because when people are sick and dying during the production of meat, I don\u2019t want to be one who says, in effect, \u201cLet \u2019em die. Hire somebody else, haw-haw.\u201d\n(Yeah, yeah, I know: This valuing of dead meat over human lives is part of what keeps the economy going. Or will kickstart it again at some point. Or whatever. The fact is, people who aren\u2019t exactly stupid are expecting a complete breakdown of society, along with all all the shooting, killing, looting, raiding, that goes along with such a breakdown.

In the UK, we don\u2019t have such huge meat processing plants, and there is actually a move back to slaughtering and processing on site - of course our farms are VERY much smaller. There is a demand for high quality meat like this, especially from rare breeds.\nIf Trump is going to mandate that the processing plants stay open, then he also has to mandate that the workers can be properly protected in terms of PPE, especially surgical grade masks - since that is what they are doing - SURGERY - and also that they are able keep proper social distancing.

We still don't have enough PPE to keep them safe.\nI get that it could be necessary. And if so I understand that. But it's like drafting people into the military and saying I don't have a helmet or a flak jacket for you, but go ahead and run at the enemy and be a target. And Swift has had PPE orders diverted by the same person ordering them to return to work. How batshit insane is that? It's not just not giving them a helmet before sending them off to war, it's going by as they head to the front lines and taking their helmet away from them.\nThis is a personal example of how we are not prepared. I have an employee whose father works for JBS Swift in Minnesota. Their pork plant just shut down last Monday because they had a massive outbreak of covid 19 at work and the inability to protect their employees currently and social distance.\nMy employees dad was sent home and laid off but was given a test last Monday. He was told the test would take a few days, and he would get a call if he was positive. Well they didn't have enough re-agents to run all the tests in a timely manner. And last Sunday he went over to his son's house (my employees home), to drop off a bike. Thinking that he was in the clear since he didn't get a call. And yes they didn't really practice social distancing too well for the 10 or 15 minutes he was there. and on Monday that employee came to work and Monday night the dad finally got the call that yes he was positive.\nSo now I have an employee out of work for 2 weeks. And that employee called yesterday because he works in a very essential business, and has a family he will need to isolate from for 2 weeks if he can't get a test to see if he's positive or not. He was told he would not be able to get a test unless he starts showing symptoms because still we don't have the ability to test everybody who needs it. So instead of being able to return to work, he's going to be out for two weeks.\nAlso for me I spent yesterday performing a tracing on where that employee was, who he may have come into contact with, ensuring he had his PPE on all day, etc. Determining if this would shut us down or send people into self isolation. So yes reopening them are going to put people's lives at risk. People will die. People's wives and husbands at home will die. Other essential businesses may be shut down or have their capacities greatly reduced because of this inability to properly protect and test.\nAnd I can see saying ore people will die if we can't keep the food manufacturing going.

There was only so much capacity to switch over from grocery sales going from 50% of share of stomach to 63%.\nThat means that there is no way to process Ag inputs into sellable items for the supermarkets. On the input side you have an excess that you need to landfill while the consumer is suffering food shortages.\nThere is no quick fix other than everyone going back to buying much more of their food through restaurants.\nIt would take billions in capital to convert supply chains geared for food service over to retail. No one is going to invest in doing such a thing during and economic downturn.\nIn March, Americans shopped at the grocery store like it was 1996", "No stats that I have so far seen, but good guesses are: 1. near zero sit-down restaurant patronage, and \u201cfood consumed away from home\u201d now takes up a full quarter of the median household food spending (and, for some reason we\u2019re not given, food consumed at home hasn\u2019t increased to make up the difference) ; and, 2., possibly, typical US surpluses ( grains, hogs, etc.) ordinarily destined for export aren\u2019t being bought by, e.g., China.\nMH", "Why has the US food distribution chains broken down so much that farmers are destroying crops?\nI worked at Tyson Foods, and a couple other meat companies over 30 years. Part of that time, I managed operation facilities, and part of that time, I managed analysts who balanced supply and demand for the company. So let\u2019s take a quick look at what the supply chain is:\nFirst, for most food items, there is a long planning window. For chickens, we planned two years in advance. Any shutdowns of a facility had to be planned months in advance. For animals, you have to plan the breeding stock, and the facilities to raise the animals in, and the processing capacity. You can\u2019t just stop processing, because there is no where for the animals to go. So you run out of housing quickly.\nThe same is true for fruits and vegetables. If there is nowhere for the product to go, it has to be destroyed. Most food products have a limited shelf life.\nThere is some inventory capacity nationwide. USDA tracks it and reports it here: USDA Economics, Statistics and Market Information System\nThe problem with inventory is: there isn\u2019t much of it, and it is usually products that are out of balance, or planned inventory builds for seasonal demands. For example, there is a huge demand for chicken wings during March Madness. A huge demand for hams around Easter, or Christmas. Bacon moves quickly in the summer for BLT sandwiches.\nNow on to the demand side of the equation. There are basically two channels: Foodservice and Retail. During this pandemic, a large portion of the foodservice channel has been stopped. The processing of those products usually takes place in different facilities than that of the retail products. So the supply is backing up rapidly. Some of it can be used to fill the greater demand in Retail, as people stay at home and eat more there. But there is also a problem with processing, as meat plants have had higher sickness rates, especially some of the largest ones. People are working close together there, and it is hard to change the configuration of the workstation layout.\nSo the short version is: a supply chain is made up of production, processing and inventory management. Production is being disrupted because of a backup on the demand side. Processing is being disrupted because people are getting sick, facilities are shutting down, and facilities are geared to process for either Foodservice or Retail, but usually not both. Inventory is quickly consumed if the demand is there, and capacity is taken up by out of balance supply. It can be a real mess.\nI watched a video yesterday of an onion farmer destroying his product. Restaurants closed down so he had no where to send the onions. He has to make a decision to plant his next crop soon, and he is unsure of whether things will be better then, or not. He has a lot less revenue to pay for his planting expenses.\nCorn farmers are in the same boat. Many animals are being euthanized due to low demand or limited processing capacity. That takes away the demand for the feed ingredients. Corn futures prices are at the lowest level they have been since 2006, and actual cash prices for corn are almost $0.50 below the futures prices. For corn, that is well below the cost of production.", "Crops (as in grain crops are not being destroyed) have a pretty long shelf life and can stay in storage as long as necessary to get the transportation industry running effectively and grain processing back on track. The livestock sector is being annihilated however. When livestock reach harvest weight they have to move out to make room for the next group of animals that have been born. Breeding herds are slowing down to help reduce supply, but that won\u2019t help us in the near term with overweight livestock that lose significant value when past the prime harvest weight. Calves born today will be ready for the packing plant in about 18 mos. Pigs born today in about 5\u20136 mos. Slowing animal births now doesn\u2019t do anything to deal with the oversupply of animals today. When the packing industry slows or stops, it stops the flow of meat into the market place. With many packing plants shut down, the available supply of meat increases in price, but the value of the live animals declines significantly because there are more than can be processed. If you want meat, find a livestock feeder and buy animals direct from them and use a local locker plant to process it for you.", "When it is produced, food is typically already sold, marked to be processed for a specific set of end users. The supply chain then processes, packages, and distributes it based on how those end users want and need it.\nThe problem is that we largely shut down institutional end users. Restaurants, schools, etc. The problem is that the infrastructure that supports the latter is often incompatible with the former. You don't buy loose bananas at the grocery. Few home cooks need a gallon can of hominy. Families tend to buy milk by the gallon or half gallon, not by the 1cup minicarton.\nSome of this processing and distribution infrastructure can be adapted, but that isn't an instantaneous process. Even if they want to change (many will wait it out so they don't have to change back once those institutions are back online), it will take time. Time food doesn't have: milk, fresh fruits and veggies, etc spoil and cannot be used before they are bad.\nEssentially the food supply chain hasn't broken, we just closed off a big section of where that food can go, and the chain that is running now is already at capacity. It isn't good, but it isn't surprising nor a sign of the system breaking.\nFor the system actually breaking, keep your eyes on meat processing plants. If the big processors cannot keep operations going, challenging with the nature of the work and coronavirus, expect an actual breakdown to start soon enough, limiting meat availability.", "Because there\u2019s a terrible new disease out there that is killing people by the thousands and oeople are afraid of getting it. The industries that bought and used the food have shit down. Shipping and exports have decreased dramatically. And now processing centers are closing because workers are getting sick AND because there\u2019s some possibility of food being contaminated. So farmers have nowhere to send the food. Almost no one is buying it. Very simply: 1.Farmers sell to processors. 2.Processors sell to distributors. 3.Distributors sell to exporters and retail and to other food industry businesses. With most of 3 and huge sections of 2 gone 1 has nowhere to sell their food so it has to be destroyed otherwise it rots in the fields and warehouses.", "Im my opinion??\nBecause people are lazy, complacent, lack critical thinking skills, have lost sight of objective reality, and are dependent on industrial farming!\nThe solution: each neighborhood should have a community farm", "Why? A deadly virus shut down the economy. One third of the economy won\u2019t produce anything today.", "The story here begins with what I would call \u201cUsers\u201d, literally people who make a business of using other people. The story also begins with the fascination certain parties have had with encouraging illegal immigration.\nThe meat packing industry has a tremendous aversion to paying its labor well and to use people up about like they were slabs of meat. To describe this situation as cass as it deserves would violate Quora terms of service. This is the cut version. In order to do this these people undertook a very well financed campaign to get what was essentially a slave labor force. This was much of the funding of the effort to get illegal aliens into the USA. They hired lobbyists and press and all sorts of parties to do this. This was the \u201ccaravans\u201d. This was the sanctuary cities!\nOver the years the labor force in these meat packing plants grew to be even more and more illegal Mexicans and Central Americans. At the same time the ownership of these plants was sold like Smithfield to the Chinese. That allowed the management of these plants to become in the hands of the single most racist batch of people on the earth and to even prohibit access of Americans to the management. So the evolution of these plants became into Chinese sweatshops manned by non-english speaking people who feared for their lives if they even spoke up about inhuman conditions in the plants. This in no small part was highly opposed by President Trump and his supporters who got called racist bigots for opposing it.\nAlong comes SARS-CoV2 and COVID-19. Under the intense severe conditions in these plants and the inhumane housing conditions encouraged by these companies the living conditions of the labor force in these plants became dire and very infective. Over time nearly all of these plants have become incubators for the COVID-19 epidemic.\nWith outbreaks of COVID-19 in the plants the situation is very dire. The management opted to shut these plants down rather than do anything to fix this situation as the epidemic exploded in the plants. In the Albertville/Boaz area of Alabama or example several of these plants became site for over 300 infections during the week measured ending on 4/28/2020. There will be fatalities and these are a genuine threat to the public health. Similar outbreaks happened at many other facilities in the USA. The result of this is that the plants became contaminated and additional workers will get sick.\nThe problem with this is a Hobson\u2019s choice (caught between a rock and a hard place) where if the normal operation of law which would shut down such a facility happens the people of the USA will starve to death. The top imparitive is to keep the plants open so people have food to eat. Obviously there is a risk to the food supply quality as well as to additional labor force.\nThis situation has exposed how evil this system of illegal immigration is and how intolerable it is. It has exposed how dangerous it is to allow foreign ownership of US Corporations as well. It is a very bad situation and frankly I cannot blame President Trump for keeping the plants open but this situation is profoundly bad. Remember it was the deliberate and continued advocacy of illegal immigration that became Cause Celeb of the Democrat Party and of the \u201cNever Trumper\u201d GOP leaders that has caused this situation. It is similar to their actions causing the USA to be 97% dependent on China for medicines and PPE etc.\nI can only ask a fair question to everyone. Was it worth it? Did we really have to tolerate such awful things? Was betrayal of the USA worth it? You could catch SARS-CoV2 from your food now because of the fact that we got so many people sick from treating them so poorly while calling this \u201cracist\u201d to oppose it.

Varieties include pollock, cod, and sole. [https://www.chooseyourfish.org/fish/pages/guide-to-fish-flavor-texture\n]\nThe catch is that mild fish needs to be very fresh. All fish becomes \u201cfishy\u201d if not handled properly, and the mild white fish varieties don\u2019t have enough flavor to disguise \u201coff\u201d tastes. Fish from typical American grocery stores is often a bit off because it takes a while for fish to get from the water to the grocery store display, and there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for improper handling. The average American grocery store consumers who think they don\u2019t like the taste of fish might have more success (or at least more consistency) with a more strongly flavored fish instead of more mild fish. In my experience, white fish is fine when it\u2019s fresh enough, but the white fish from grocery stores is highly variable and more often nasty in flavor, not just \u201cmild\u201d.\nHowever, it might be useful to take a step back and examine why would people ask which fish have the mildest flavor to begin with. More often than not, people look for mild fish because they\u2019ve been told that fish is healthy and they want to try to acquire (or convince a loved one to acquire) a taste for fish. Feeding a fish-hater mild fish is not a useful way to help them like fish or to improve their health. There are other (more cost-effective and environmentally friendly) ways to consume equally healthy nutrients, and tolerating mild fish is not the same as appreciating fish or acquiring a taste for fish. Besides, fish is expensive, so acquiring a taste for fish doesn\u2019t do the person any favors.\nIf the person has enough disposable income to acquire a taste for fish, then the best way to do it is to go on vacations. A type of vacation that might help people acquire a taste for fish is to travel to places on the ocean known for good seafood, like Hawaii\n, Hokkaido, the Caribbean, and other islands. Find good restaurants that will serve a variety of fish and try a range of them. Different fish have different flavors, and many are delicious (and not \u201cfishy\u201d). Why would someone eat a mild (often also called \u201cbland\u201d) white fish (even if it\u2019s fresh) when they could be eating rich smoky mackerel or savory and flavorful shishamo instead? Good sushi restaurants can be great for helping people sample a wide range of fish prepared differently.\nIf people still don\u2019t like fish, it\u2019s fine. People don\u2019t have to eat fish to be healthy. Also, some people might dislike fish because they\u2019re sensitive or mildly allergic to some of the environmental pollutants that accumulate in the bodies of some fish.

Short answer: no.\nMandatory food labels are needed for things that have some sort of health consequence. For example, peanuts can cause severe and even fatal reactions for people that are allergic to them, so it\u2019s important that they be listed on the label. I would argue the same should be true for gluten, as people with celiac disease can be made quite ill by exposure.\nHere\u2019s Health Canada\u2019s take on the issue: \u201cThere are no specific laws in Canada about labelling GM foods differently. They are labelled like any other food because our safety assessments have found them to be as safe and nutritious as non-GM foods.\u201d\nIn Canada at least, we regulate the product, not the process used to make that product. Example: whether you produce your vitamin C tablets by extracting it from oranges or synthesizing it in a lab, it\u2019s the same stuff, so it doesn\u2019t get a label.\nThere are also belief-based labels that food manufacturers put on their products. This includes kosher and halal labels for religious beliefs, and Non-GMO Project for social beliefs. Manufacturers voluntarily add and pay for these labels to attract certain customer groups.\nThat said, there\u2019s an argument to be made for labelling GMO foods, both to ease some people\u2019s fears, and to counter anti-GMO groups\u2019 criticisms. In late 2018, the USDA came up with a National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard which I think strikes a nice balance.\nIf I were advising food manufacturers, I would take this a bit further and label it something along the lines of \u201cBioengineered for Better Nutrition\u201d or \u201cBioengineered for Environmental Sustainability\u201d depending on the product. It would go a long way to easing people\u2019s fears and providing useful information for them to guide their purchases.\nHealth Canada Labelling of GM or other novel foods: Labelling genetically-modified (GM) foods\nUSDA National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard: BE Disclosure | Agricultural Marketing Service", "Ah, yes.

The reality is that most of us take in far too much, thanks mainly to processed and fast foods, not a heavy hand with the saltshaker. The very latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans call for eating less than 2,300 milligrams \u2014 or, one teaspoon of table salt \u2014 each day. If you\u2019re on a low-sodium diet, your intake should be even lower.\nThe very easiest way to cut sodium is to avoid what the American Heart Association terms the salty six: bread, pizza, sandwiches, cold/cured meats, soup, and burritos/tacos. These popular, convenient, readily available foods have sky-high sodium (one cup of canned soup, for instance, could have half your daily allotment of sodium, for instance).Soup isn\u2019t the only canned good to watch for \u2014 otherwise good-for-you canned vegetables, fruits, fish, and beans can also have surprisingly high amounts of sodium.\nTake beans: A single serving of canned black beans contains 459 milligrams of sodium (that\u2019s 20 percent of your daily value right there). But if you\u2019re trying to avoid sodium, the answer isn\u2019t to eliminate all canned foods from your shopping cart. This would lead to missing out on all sorts of important foods, says Diana Orenstein, RD, a dietitian at Newton-Wellesley Hospital, who notes that canned foods can be a great source of nutrients, as well as being budget-friendly and super-convenient.\nHere\u2019s how to make sure you get the benefits from omega-rich canned fish, fiber-full beans, and nutrient-packed canned vegetables \u2014 without taking in excess sodium.\nHere\u2019s How to Decode Your Label\nEven though sodium can be used as a preservative, it does not need to be, says Orenstein, since \u201cthe canning process itself is the preservative.\u201d\nThat means you\u2019ll find plenty of canned foods on supermarket shelves that do not have high levels of sodium \u2014 or any at all! Orenstein recommends looking for cans that say low sodium, very low sodium, or sodium-free on their labels. These are FDA-regulated claims with strict definitions (to be classified as low sodium, for instance, a food must have 140 milligrams or less of sodium per serving).\nTread carefully, though, if you see \u201creduced sodium\u201d on the label. That too is an FDA-regulated claim, and requires only that the sodium be reduced 25 percent from the regular product. \u201cThis can still leave a high amount of sodium remaining,\u201d says Orenstein.\nThe FDA provides a helpful guideline to follow as you examine the nutritional label on a can: \u201c5% DV or less of sodium per serving is considered low, and 20% DV or more of sodium per serving is considered high.\u201d And don\u2019t forget to check the serving size, too \u2014 often, the serving size on the package is far less than the amount you\u2019ll eat."], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020"], "question_author": "Daniel Guerra", "view_list": [1, 10, 5, 47]}, "662": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 3, "name_list": ["Shashank Rawat", "Monika Raghuvanshi", "RV Mythily"], "question_title": "What is Bhog?", "topic_list": ["English Word Definitions, Terminology, and Jargon", "Phrase Definitions", "Music", "Food"], "no_of_view": "69", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["Blissful hygiene offering to God\nSource - Google (\u2022\u203f\u2022)", "Bhog (n.

That means anywhere in Central and most of South America, Mexico, the North American southwest and anywhere that traditional dishes from those cultures are served.

There\u2019s at least some evidence leading us to believe that they thought that Native Americans treated their corn for reasons of flavor, and it was a flavor the colonists didn\u2019t care for. Whatever the reason, non-nixtamalized corn became the standard for colonists. Settlers then expanded across North America, replacing native populations and their lifeways as they went.

Although brown rice is a healthier choice than white, your body will digest the white variety faster. ... Summary: Rice is easy to digest. White rice can be digested faster than brown rice, even though the brown variety is more nutritious. Besides the phytic acid contained in legumes, the harder beans such as kidney and navy beans contain oligosaccharides. This complex sugar is impossible to digest without some help because humans do not produce the enzyme alpha-galactosidase needed to properly break it down. YOU ALSO ASK HERE AND GET ANSWER WITHIN HOUR: https://bit.ly/2wPj36s", "They digest like most starches. Rice and beans are usually a good combination for complete proteins in vegetarian diets. The trick with digesting beans is to thoroughly chew them, so that the ptyalin in your saliva breaks down the starch. The bean starch consists of long chains of sugars (oligosaccharides) and some people cannot break them down. So, the undigested sugars ferment and give way to flatulence.", "The same thing that happens to anything you eat\u2026quick summary\u2026food begins being digested in the mouth where it is chewed into smaller pieces and the enzyme amylase breaks down starch into simpler sugars that can be further broken down in the small intestine. About 30% of starch digestion takes place in the mouth. From there it goes to the stomach which secretes acid and powerful enzymes that continue the process of breaking down the food. From there to the small intestine which continues the breaking down process by using enzymes released from the pancreas and bile from the liver. Bile is a compound that aids in the digestion of fat and eliminates waste products from the blood. Peristalsis moves the food along and mixes it up with digestive secretions. Waste left over from the digestive process is passed through the colon and finally emptied into the rectum.\nRice is easily digestible, but sometimes people have trouble digesting beans. This is because our bodies lack the digestive enzymes to process oligosaccharides. We do have some of the enzyme, but it resides only in our stomach bacteria, and if we don\u2019t eat beans regularly, we likely won\u2019t have quite enough of it to digest them without trouble.\nBecause I never met a bean I didn\u2019t like, I\u2019m going to give you a couple of important tips. One, soak your beans before cooking them because it releases the tricky oligosaccharides that cause discomfort. You can do a quick soak or a long soak. For a quick soak, rinse and pick over the beans, then cover them with water (1 part beans; 3 parts water) and boil them for five minutes. Let them sit for an hour after, and then finish cooking through. For a long soak, just rinse and pick over, then put them in water overnight or for 8 hours. Drain and change water before cooking through. For most beans this will be about an hour. Two, don\u2019t salt beans while you cook them; flavor them after they\u2019re cooked. Salting will cook beans faster, but they\u2019ll be tougher in texture and may not have the same digestibility that slow cooking and soaking afford.\nAnd finally, the prevailing wisdom said that vegans had to eat a \u201ccomplete\u201d protein at each meal by pairing foods together - rice and beans, for example. We now know that is is not the case as long as vegans take care to get all essential amino acids over the course of each day. Whether or not they are eaten together is not essential, but it is a good way to remind yourself.\nSource:\nYour Digestive System\n10 Tips for Better Bean Digestion; A Few Announcements | The Full Helping", "The same mechanical (transport) and chemical processes that digest all other foods: Digestion - Wikipedia\nRice and beans are mainly carbohydrate, protein, and fiber."], "date_list": ["Apr 2, 2020", "Sep 17, 2018", "Feb 12, 2018", "Jan 31, 2018", "Jan 30, 2018"], "question_author": "Mati Faith", "view_list": [82, 57, 0, 0, 0]}, "65": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What is the best to eat in Jalahalli West, Bangalore?", "topic_list": ["Restaurant Recommendations", "Bengaluru, Karnataka, India", "Restaurants", "Eating", "Food"], "no_of_view": "271", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Jaya Pilai", "view_list": []}, "378": {"no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 7, "name_list": ["Olivia Clark", "Vincent Reddy", "Vihung Marathe", "Hardy Mletzko", "Sharon Griffin Squire", "Gail Basile-Wiffler", "Terry Lo"], "question_title": "If you freeze fresh parsley, will it keep to use it later on?", "topic_list": ["Parsley", "Frozen Food", "Food Storage", "Food Preservation", "Freezing", "Vegetables", "Cooking", "Food"], "no_of_view": "3,805", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["Yes if\u2026\nYou freeze dry it.

In general, frozen food will keep for three months in a standard home freezer. The FDA has specific recommendations for the shelf life for foods, but if you aren't using your frozen goods within three months, you're probably buying too much.\nWhat foods can you freeze?\nAccording to the USDA, you can freeze almost any food. However, some foods don't freeze well; apples and pears will turn mushy when defrosted, cream sauces will separate and raw tomatoes will never be the same (but you can still put them in sauces).\nFortunately, there are many foods that freeze and defrost beautifully. So, go ahead and stock up on these 10 pantry staples you can freeze:\nMilk\nThe Dairy Council of California says it's fine to freeze milk as long as it's not past the sell-by date. One thing to remember when it comes to freezing milk (and other liquids) is that it will expand when frozen. So you'll need to leave extra space in the container or it will burst. It's better to pour the milk into freezer-safe containers first (jugs of milk take up way too much space anyway), then freeze. To use frozen milk, thaw it in the refrigerator or in cold water -- never let it thaw at room temperature.\nEggs\nEggs are freezable but require a little bit of prep work before they go into the deep freeze. The American Egg Board recommends removing the eggs from their shells before you freeze them. To freeze whole eggs, crack each egg separately into a bowl. Beat just until blended (try not to whip too much air into the mixture). Pour the egg mixture into freezer containers, seal and label with the number of eggs and date, then freeze. Thaw the same way you would milk.\nCheese\nNot all cheeses should be frozen. Soft cheeses such as brie and double cr\u00e8me and low-fat cheeses should not be frozen because their texture and flavor is altered in the thawing process. However, cheddar, havarti, mozzarella, parmesan, feta or any \"hard\" cheese and all shredded cheeses freeze nicely.\nBefore you pop chunks of cheese into the freezer, cut them into hand-size portions, then wrap the pieces in aluminium foil before placing them in a freezer bag. Shredded cheese can go straight into a freezer bag. Make sure to remove any excess air before sealing, then freeze. When you're ready to use the cheese, thaw it in the refrigerator and use it within the next three days.\nButter\nBoth salted and unsalted butter freeze well. If it's regular stick butter, keep in its original carton and put that in a resealable freezer storage bag. For spreadable butter, you'll need to remove it from its original packaging because that's not freezer-grade, and transfer it to a freezer-safe container.\nBread\nSliced bread and whole loaves freeze extremely well. In fact, so do bagels, English muffins, baked biscuits, cookies and other bread products. When frozen correctly, bread products will maintain their freshness for at least three months. For breads right out of the oven, allow them to cool completely before wrapping. Wrap each loaf tightly in plastic wrap, then also wrap it in foil or freezer paper. Double wrapping will help keep it fresh.\nSliced bread, cookies or biscuits need to be flash-frozen first so they don't stick together. Lay them out individually on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Put the baking sheet into the freezer for at least 2 hours, then place the flash-frozen bread into a freezer-safe bag with all of the air pressed out. The best way to thaw frozen bread is in the microwave or oven.\nFlour\nDo you really need to freeze flour? Well, not all-purpose flour, although it will help extend its shelf life. However, whole-grain flours such as rye and wheat have a higher fat content than all-purpose and will turn rancid quickly at room temperature. So, these absolutely should be stored in the freezer. The only prep work you need to do for flour is to put it into a strong, food-grade plastic bag or container, then pop in the freezer. Do this for almond flour too.\nChocolate\nMost chocolate will last a long time at room temperature, but if your room temperature is warmer than average, freezing your favorite chocolate bars and even truffles and bonbons is doable -- though it's a two-step process. In order to effectively freeze chocolate without altering its texture once thawed, you should bring its temperature down slowly. Wrap the chocolate tightly in heavy-duty freezer bags, then place the chocolate in the refrigerator for several hours before placing it in the freezer.\nFresh herbs\nUsing fresh herbs in recipes adds a brightness and flavor you just can't get with dried herbs. But what do you do with all that extra cilantro you bought for Tex-Mex night you didn't use? Mix an equal amount of chopped herbs and olive oil (or another oil) in a bowl. Then, scoop the herb mixture into an ice cube tray and freeze. Once frozen, pop them out of the ice tray and store in a freezer bag. Toss a cube or two into your recipe when needed.\nCooked rice and pasta\nThis cooking hack is a time-saver. Cook large batches of plain pasta or rice, but leave them slightly underdone since this saves them from turning mushy when reheated. Let cool completely and package them into smaller portions in freezer-safe bags or other airtight containers. When you need pasta or rice for a recipe, sprinkle it with a bit of water and heat it up in the microwave.\nNuts\nNuts should always be stored in the freezer. Because they're high in fat, they're perishable goods. Buying them in bulk can help you save money, but if you store them in the pantry at room temperature, they can go rancid. Chop nuts and place in an airtight bag or container and freeze. Just scoop out what you need for your recipe and leave the rest in the freezer."], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020"], "question_author": "Vita Lea", "view_list": [1, 27]}, "507": {"no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 3, "name_list": ["Pearl Lederman", "Som Shubhra De", "Rana Bahadur Bhadel"], "question_title": "Can some one eat pineapple during cough?", "topic_list": ["Pineapples", "Coughing", "Fruit", "Eating", "Food", "Medicine and Healthcare"], "no_of_view": "356", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["i would ask your doctor about it", "You can but you may not !\nPineapple though very nutritious fruit and laden with Vitamin C, is vary tangy.

From the technological point of view, pouch milk is merely a pasteurized milk wherein milk gets heat treated round about 80 degree centigrade and being hold at that temperature for 16 seconds and immediately chilled to 4 degree centigrade temperature followed by packing under the Form Fill Seal Machines and stored. The pasteurization process effectively kills the bacterial load present in the raw/incoming milk to a safe level (under 20000cfu/ml SPC count). Basically, these counts would tend to increase and multiply in certain folds when temperature abuse take place during transportation or storage. By the time you receive this pouch milk and store it in your refrigerator count would have increased to somewhere 50000 cfu/ml due to cold chain breaks and thus such milk ideally should be consumed within a day or two. Essentially, needs to be refrigerated all the time to ensure these increase counts do not multiply and curdled the milk. Refrigeration temperature would reduce the growth of bacterial multiplication. Only certain type of psychrophilic bacteriawould tend to grow at a very little rate at this controlled refrigerated temperature.\nComing to the point of tetra pack milk, the processing of milk takes place at a very high temperature of 140 degree centigrade and being hold at this temperature for 1 second. This process called as High Temperature Short Time (HTST) essentially employed for the milk expected to have longer shelf life. This high temperature and time combination kills every single bacteria in the milk (sometimes spores too) and render the milk with absolute zero count. This doesnt end here. After practicing above method, the milk necessarily have to go through stringent and enclosed packing process wherein ascetic filling into the tetra pack (6 layer packaging material) is carried out. This highly innovative packaging form ensures close to zero transmission of bacteria from outer side. Thus, such milk would tend to be stable even at normal temperature until the barriers in the tetra pack material starts to wear out and let the environmental load into the container.\nNot to mentioned while one renders the increased shelf life with advancement in process and packaging, it also negatively affects the nutritional availability of certain minerals and vitamins along with the freshness.\nFootnotes\n[1] Pratik's answer to Does Mother Dairy's Live Lite Milk have a lot of preservatives for rendering to be stored without refrigeration for 90 days?"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Shri Vishwa Prasad Singh", "view_list": [19, 5, 49, 20]}, "31": {"no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 5, "name_list": ["Jed McCann", "Doug Yensan", "Dave Keough", "Daniel Murphy", "Jake Guthmiller"], "question_title": "Now that Trump has demanded that food/meat processing plants reopen while with thousands of workers having to work next to other infected workers, shouldnt Trump reward all those workers with legal immigration status since most are illegal?", "topic_list": ["Trump Immigration Policies (2017-)", "Immigration Policy", "Illegal Immigration", "Trump Administration (2017-Present)", "Immigration to the United States of America", "Immigration", "Donald Trump (politician, business person)", "Politics of the United States of America", "Food", "The United States of America"], "no_of_view": "2,151", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 3, 1, 2], "ans_list": ["If the Trump administration is going to grant employers immunity from the consequences of their unsafe workplaces, and Republican governors are going to deem employees who refuse to return to work because their workplace is unsafe as ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits, then maybe we should do a little something to benefit those workers.

Exercise daily for at least an hour. ...\nEat the Right Foods and Portion Each Meal. ...\nKeep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per Day. ...\nBe Sure to Get Sleep. ...\nStay Motivated.\n5 Simple Tips for Fitness Success\nCongratulations on taking a forward step to get in shape and feel great. Many people are guilty of wishing they could get a sculpted body from eating junk food and watching TV all day. But that is just not going to happen. Even though getting in shape sounds like a long, time-wasting process, the effort put towards being in shape has many positive effects. If you want to start your journey to having a better body to feel great, here are some tips:\n1. Exercise Daily\nExercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking to shed a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk pace for an hour. Or, you can jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour. Make sure you're not in severe pain during your workout. Just a warning, your muscles will ache after a high intensity workout. It may be irritating, but that means your body is changing for the better. Be sure to stay hydrated, stretch, and eat foods with a decent amount of protein after each workout. The protein will help keep your muscles, not fat, rebuilding.\n2. Eat the Right Foods and Portion Each Meal\nNo matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try to stay away from sweets. Sugar from candy will not help you get in shape. Even if it's just a single candy bar, one will eventually lead to another. Fruits and vegetables are the best thing to eat when getting into shape. Apples, for example, do a good job at making the stomach feel full for up to 3 to 4 hours. Green vegetables such as green beans and broccoli keep the digestive system clean and running.\nAlso, stick to lean meats like turkey and chicken. Seafood, such as, shrimp, and tilapia are also great alternatives. These foods are full of protein and healthy nutrients to help keep muscles fit and ready for workouts. In addition, be sure to portion what you eat. Having a good metabolism comes from portioning meals. Try to plan out eating six times a day and setting smaller portions, rather than having three large meals throughout the day. This will also help you find yourself breathing smoother when working out rather than huffing and puffing for air. This is because you will have less food in your digestive system, which means more energy is used toward your exercise.\n3. Keep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per Day\nKeeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out your physical exercising. Ever wonder why body builders' body masses are so big? That's because they plan out their meals and take in more (healthy) calories than the average person. On the other hand, losing weight and striving for a skinnier physique will involve more physical exercise than calories you ingest.\n4. Be Sure to Get Sleep\nEven though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get enough sleep to recharge the body's batteries. Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the body going throughout the day, but if you happen to feel tired at any point after coming home from work, by all means take a small nap before exercising. You should only nap for about a half hour. This will prevent you from staying up later in the night.\n5. Stay Motivated\nAn important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. If you stay positive, you will be able to push yourself to get that fit body you've always wanted.\nErie Cross Training Examiner Kyle Melerski\n, a music technology student at Capital University, is on the rise by using his creative writing skills to inform and entertain people.\nExaminer.com\nis the inside source for everything local.

It is not necessary that an ageing man is the only one that has to go through the problem of decreased stamina, in today\u2019s time even young men also face this problem. Some of the common reasons for decrease in sexual stamina are listed below", "Pubococcygeus Muscle/Kegel Exercise\nThere are muscles in your body that you can train to control your ejaculatory responses and last longer in bed. They are called the pubococcygeus muscle, or PC for short. PC muscles stretch from the pubic bone to the tailbone, and are present in both men and women. Naturally you are asking yourself, how does the PC muscle relate to lasting longer in bed? The PC muscle is actually the muscle responsible for releasing semen during ejaculation. Thus, when the PC muscle stays in a relaxed state, it prevents you from reaching ejaculation.\nKeeping the PC muscle in a relaxed state during sex is not difficult, however it is something that needs to be worked on. Similar to your other muscles, the stronger they are, the easier it is for those muscles to relax in the face of pressure. Only when the pressure gets a little too much will the muscles get forced to leave its relaxed state. In other words, building stronger PC muscle will also build your tolerance to pressure (read: pleasure) come game time. And like all muscles, you need to exercise in order to train your PC muscle. In fact, you may already be familiar with the PC workout regime: the Kegel exercise.\nThe Kegel was discovered by Dr. Arnold Kegel in the 1940s with the purpose of helping women regain tighteness in their vaginas after giving birth. As it turns out, Kegels aren\u2019t only beneficial for women, but also for men\u2014as you are about to discover.\nThere are many benefits of the Kegel exercise, not the least great health benefits for your prostate, however I will cite only sex-related benefits for our purposes:\nKegel will help men control their ability to orgasm, giving them greater sexual endurance.\nKegel will help men maintain harder erections for a longer period of time, thanks to improvement in penile blood flow.\nKegel will help men increase ejaculation force, which results in a more explosive orgasm.\nKegel will indirectly enlarge the penis and the size of erection, again through improvement in penile blood flow.\nIn addition to working the pubococcygeus muscle, Kegel exercises also contract the ischiocavernosus (IC) and bulbocavernosus (BC or bulbospongiosus) muscles. The IC muscle compresses the root of the corpus cavernosum, one of the penile erectile bodies (the penis has three erectile bodies: two corpora cavernosa and one corpus spongiosum, through which the urethra passes). The BC compresses the root of the corpus spongiosum and the urethra, and these muscles assist in the expulsion of urine and semen during ejaculation. The corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum are separate erectile chambers, and erection is triggered by the surrounding muscles. Both the IC and BC muscles reflexively contract during erection to make the penis larger and stiffer. This reflexive contraction reaches its peak at orgasm, at which time the penis noticeably swells. Therefore, frequent orgasms will help keep the IC and BC muscles in well-toned shape. Conscious contraction of both muscles will result in perceptible swelling without orgasm. However, while these muscles can be exercised with a flaccid penis, exercising with an erect penis mimics the natural state in which these muscles contract, and thus will yield better results.\nFood\nThere are certain foods that you can consume specifically for the purpose of increased endurance in bed. Unlike drugs, these are common food that you may have eaten without even realizing their potency in improving your sex life. They are also relatively safe from detrimental side effects as long as they are consumed in normal amounts.\nDopamine and serotonin are two hormones naturally produced by your body. People with mental problems are often given drugs that will produce more of either hormone to get better. This should give you an idea of how much they affect you not only mentally, but also in all aspects of your life. However, when it comes to sexual endurance, dopamine will help you last longer, while serotonin may exacerbate premature ejaculation.\nResearch indicated that the brain secretes a burst of serotonin after ejaculation. This results in a decline in sexual excitement and erectile ability. When serotonin level slowly dissipates, erectile ability returns. While there are drugs that can act as serotonin inhibitor, you can minimize or eliminate serotonin\u2019s undesirable effect during intercourse by consuming a high-protein, low-carbohydrate meal before sex.\nPhenylethylamine and phenylalanine: High-protein meals contain more phenylethylamine and phenylalanine (an amino acid), which serves to reduce serotonin. Phenylalanine tablets are also available for this purpose. Other foods that contain phenylethylamine include salami and chocolate, though you should avoid chocolates that are high in sugar as it actually increases serotonin. Chocolates also contain the libido-boosting methylxanthines.\nGinseng and Vitamin B6: People have been using natural herbs like Panax ginseng, Maca root, green onions, aswagandha, ginger, honey, garlic, and the roots of Asparagus as libido-boosting tonics for centuries. While not all of them have clear benefits for premature ejaculation treatment, they do not result in undesirable side effects, so trying them out should not cause you any harm.\nGinseng\u2019s role in combating PE should no longer be in doubt. Both garlic and ginger enhances blood flow to men\u2019s penis, which helps in maintaining hard erection and combating PE. However, ginseng does a little more than that. During orgasm, we experience a surge in the hormone prolactin that serves to switch off sexual excitement. Similar to serotonin, the surge can be minimized, in this case by consumption of ginseng along with vitamin B6.\nMonounsaturated fat: Men whose diets are extremely low in fat (where fat comprises less than 10% of the calories in their diet) tend to have very low testosterone levels. Since testosterone level is incredibly important in sexual performance, it is a good idea to still consume healthy fat even when you are dieting. While I am no weight loss expert, most diet gurus right now advocate a balanced diet with proper macros ratio, so you should never skip on consuming fat anyway.\nTo increase testosterone production, consume monounsaturated fats that are found in olive oil, canola oil, red salmon, avocados, and nuts. As an aside, you should also get enough sleep as men with sleep apnea are also found to secrete abnormally low levels of testosterone during sleep.\nAntioxidants: Antioxidants are molecules that inhibit the oxidation of other molecules, terminating the production of free radicals that are bad for your health and your libido. Eating a good diet with sufficient antioxidants such as vitamins C and E will allow you to maintain not only good health (by reducing the risk of cancer and coronary heart disease) but longer intercourse sessions. Vitamin C is especially important in collagen production and reduction of stress. Incorporate leafy greens, citrus, and nuts such as almonds in your diet to boost your antioxidant level. If you find it difficult to get sufficient levels of antioxidants through diet alone, you may use antioxidant supplements, one of which is alpha-lipoic acid.\nGinkgo biloba: The herb ginkgo biloba can enhance nitric oxide production, which in turn improves arterial blood flow to the penis and allows for a strong erection. In addition, Ginkgo may restore sexual sensation and enhance libido. Ginkgo are also reported to increase penile size in the flaccid and erect state for some men, although I believe this is simply the effect of said increased blood flow to the penis. While this is rare, some people have reported that Ginkgo consumption results in headache, so if this is you, this food is not for you.\nL-arginine: L-arginine is an amino acid that has a beneficial influence on blood vessel health and nitric oxide action in the body, thus it may help with erectile dysfunction. As the blood vessels in a man\u2019s penis dilate, it increases blood flow to the region, which helps maintain an erection. Arginine also helps stimulate the secretion of growth hormones, removes ammonia from your body, and heals bodily wounds. L-arginine level can be increased by consuming protein-containing food. This includes quinoa, oats, soybeans, peanuts, walnuts, tuna, salmon, trout, tilapia, pork, beef, chicken, and dairy products. While it is hard to track the exact amount of L-arginine you consume, daily consumption of 56 grams of protein should be enough for men. Supplements are also readily available to boost your L-arginine level.\nCholine and Vitamin B5: While nitric oxide is one of the most crucial effectors of erection, there are other chemicals that are also vital in this process. One such chemical is acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that acts as a messenger carried by the nerves when the brain wishes to produce an erection. A mild elevation of acetylcholine can be achieved by ingesting foods that are rich in choline such as egg yolks, liver, and wheat germ, but choline supplements are also available. You can take choline supplements (1,000 to 3,000 milligrams) in conjunction with vitamin B5 (500 to 1,500 milligrams) for this purpose.\nMolybdenum: Molybdenum is an essential dietary trace mineral, and its deficiency can contribute to impotence. You can increase your Molybdenum levels by consuming food such as whole grain breads and cereals, liver, kidney, dark green leafy vegetables, and legumes. If you have weight loss goals, molybdenum is also something you do not want to miss, as it is involved in the utilization of carbohydrates and fats for the production of energy. It is also involved in the metabolism of iron and the prevention of tooth cavities. There also seems to be an association between molybdenum deficiency and esophageal cancer.\nPotassium: Similarly, potassium deficiency can cause impairment of arterial relaxation and decrease in testosterone production, which contributes to impotence and diminished libido. A lack of potassium is also linked with increased risk in hypertension. There are plenty of supplements that can provide you with enough potassium, but you can also satisfy your daily requirements by consuming dark leafy greens, baked potatoes, bananas, red salmon, mushroom, and avocados.\nZinc: Zinc is an essential mineral that is required to maintain a sense of smell, synthesizing protein, and keeping a healthy immune system. Zinc deficiency can lower testosterone production and cause impotence. Further, a lack of zinc may also increase estrogen. A study conducted in 1996 reported that zinc deficiency in rats reduces the number of androgen (testosterone or DHT) receptors but increases the number of estrogen receptors. Since an increase in the number of receptors increases the effect of a hormone (and vice versa), a zinc deficiency effectively increases estrogen levels and decreases androgen levels. Other symptoms of zinc deficiency range from hair loss, stunted growth, diarrhea, and a drop in immunity.\nA mild zinc deficiency is fairly common in Americans, although it is often more severe in the case of the elderly, alcoholics, and people who consume too much junk food. Almonds are rich in zinc and vitamin E, and it is touted to enhance libido and sexual desire as well. Other sources of zinc include seafood, lamb, beef, pork, chicken, spinach, and cashews. Consume them in reasonable amounts, as overconsumption may lead to headache and nausea."], "date_list": ["Apr 18, 2020", "Jan 20, 2020", "Jan 2, 2020", "Dec 5, 2019", "Nov 21, 2019", "Nov 15, 2019", "Nov 4, 2019", "Oct 11, 2019", "Mar 30, 2019", "Sep 1, 2018", "Aug 20, 2018", "Jan 8, 2018", "Oct 2, 2017"], "question_author": "Anonymous", "view_list": [21, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 541, 187, 0, 0, 0]}, "255": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Hey!

Talk to your doctor about your mercury exposure so they can order the right tests.\nHowever, I know someone who did it that way, and avoiding sushi completely for several years until her mercury levels went back down wasn\u2019t fun. Instead, it\u2019s probably easier to replace regular consumption of high-mercury fish with low-mercury fish. For example, I find that ordering more salmon and less tuna is easier than just not having sushi at all.\nOf course, even if you shift to eating fish with less mercury, regular tests are still useful. The FDA recommends only two to three servings per week of low-mercury fish, so having fish \u201cjust about every day\u201d is still a lot even if it\u2019s low in mercury.
