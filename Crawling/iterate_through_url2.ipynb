My wife of 12 years who is Uber conservative and prudish would not do or say anything about swallowing I or tasting my cum. I wish she would at least do it. However, i knew what I was getting when I started dating her/married her. Although she has come out of her shell and would say and mean the rest of it, she has never considered swallowing cum a reality and believes it’s only a porn thing, which it’s not of course…but, otherwise, she is living proof that the most prudish of women can be fantastic behind closed doors once they are comfortable with the man they wish to spend the rest of their lives with.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 3, 'question_author': 'Bob Napples', 'question_title': 'What kind of things do you like to hear from your partner while making love?', 'no_of_view': '273', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

For me it's more like my romance scale is on a completely different axis from other people's, enough that it's extremely rare for someone to hit on it. Nonetheless, I love so many people, and I'm surrounded by love in turn. How can that be?\\nWell, I've always been a little confused about how people talk about “love” like it's a bunch of different unrelated things. I've never seen this clear shining division between “friend” and “loved one” and - if we're compatible - “lover.” They're different facets, different expressions of the same feeling, and they blur and flow into each other at the edges. I've got partners where we're both genuinely unsure of when the relationship really started.\\nBut when people talk about The One and how the rest of the world falls away, how their friends disappear when they have a new partner, the chivalry and “sweep her off her feet” stuff? Does nothing for me. Bit of a turn-off, actually. That's just… not how it works, for me.

Once they all found out I was working on my doctorate, suddenly I was dating 3–4 at a time. Even at our company party when I was with my date they were flirting with me openly. Suddenly how they thought of me changed. Yes I carried myself differently, but they saw me a a potential good provider who had prospects (earning potential) which could make their lives easier.

I would be personally I little suspicious if a woman was to tell me that on the first date as well. Even my wife and I waited a couple of weeks before saying it. However, I was sold once she told me.\\nI think it depends on how much communication you two have had prior to actually dating. Love is a funny word in English because there is “I love them even into death” and then there is “OMG I LOVE HOTDOGS!” That's a pretty large grand canyon of a spectrum right?\\nNaturally, it's hard to have any idea what the dude actually thinks. I don't know him. I feel like it could be a few meanings. What idea is the word “love” expressing in this context?\\nI am really happy to be here.\\nFinally, a girl likes me!\\nI could see myself loving you, but we go hard in English and the only thing between crush and love is “I like like you” so…\\nI believe that I love the person who I am perceiving right now. Who knows about the future, but oh boy these rose colored goggles are amazing!\\nI want you to know that I am seriously committed to trying this thing out.\\nI said it. Shall we shag now or shall we shag later?\\nYou overwhelm me in the best way.\\nI know how this works. I've seen movies.\\nThe list goes on. Could it just be a red flag? Absolutely, but I think people with a deep well of feeling might deserve a little more than, “Ew girl, run.”\\nIt's up to you! Only you can decide what to take from it. You might consider asking to explain what he meant or what was going through his mind when he said it. Maybe the answer could shed some light on the subject.\\nOr you can drop him like a hot rock. Honestly, it's your choice. Just remember that love is the “After you.” of life. It's an action. Love is great because it can only give. Two people giving to each other is a beautiful thing. Two people saying it might be pretty on the surface, but if no one gives the relationship will be as hollow as the words.\\nSo, I would offer the suggestion (which you don't have to take, of course) of asking him what was on his mind when he said it but also paying attention to whether or not his actions back up his words. Then you'll just have to make your own decision.\\nGood luck!\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 2, 'question_author': 'Kristal Price', 'question_title': 'Is it normal for a man to say he loves you the first day?', 'no_of_view': '1,287', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

(I consider marriage and cohabitation as the same… am excluding the legal part of it.)\\nI am 47, I like the way women think, am attracted to a range of women, am healthy, good looking enough, work hard, and have no major social dysfunctions, fetishes, or unfair expectations in a partner that I knew of. I have never married (did believe in it), no children (not a decision not to have them), and was actively looking for love/ dating for many years before ending the search.\\nBefore figuring out the answer to this very question I had figured it was me attracting emotionally unhealthy women; I just needed to keep looking for the right type of woman. I changed focus to what I really wanted in a healthy relationship, but it didn’t seem to exist in women; I stopped actively looking about 2 years before the answer came with a discussion on InCels and the emotional equivalent in true forced loneliness (TFL).\\nWhen I gave up actively dating, I found myself habitually chasing the emotional rewards of self-sacrifice with women I like, who have no romantic interest in me, as a way of staying emotionally active in the romantic sense and to get some of my needs met. I was working through that, almost stopping the worst habits, when I learnt of TFL, but it wasn’t quite me so I looked for the answer and finally found the answer for me in the red pill philosophy.\\nAll romantic interest in women ended almost instantly when I figured out that what I was chasing wasn’t possible and that what I was chasing was normal and healthy. I tried celibacy, found out that I liked the state; my sexuality crashed for a few months, when it returned it had changed to boring. With the romantic stress gone and better health in every area of life I knew that going my own way was the best choice for me; am now committed to my freedom from the romance.\\nOne thing I discovered about myself that I never knew is that I have a very low MachIV, I suspect this was a major contributor to not marrying in my case. The other contributor was my experience around abusive men/ women, narcissists and users when I was younger, the INFJ instinct was pretty finely honed over the years. Lastly my personality and communication styles are quite unusual and flexible, as an example my DISC/ DISA profile is about evenly D (Dominant) and S (Stable). Add all of this up and it is a recipe for a happy single life.\\nThe answer I found in the red pill philosophy and the healthy emotional trait in women I was chasing but couldn’t find was in the differences in how men and women love and what they chase in romantic partnerships. For me what was on offer had minimal value, I was asking something of women they had no interest in offering. I still want it deep down but don’t even fantasise about getting it anymore.\\nThis need I will have to live with outside of the romantic relationship just as every other man does; whether he knows he has the need or not. This is the answer to your question, for some men the need for a particular type of love from women is exposed, even as just an instinct; most men only see the veil lifted after committing, causing the so called midlife crisis (it really is just awareness).'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Anonymous', 'question_title': 'Why do certain men, after years of dating, not marry?', 'no_of_view': '848', 'answer_count': 2}\n",

I looked at him for stability and escape. He looked at me for assurance and validation. We took comfort in one another and formed the most beautiful bond. It took the fear of losing him forever to convince me that I had to look at the skeletons in my closet first, before I lose myself in the process.\\nLove of self was the first step. I care for my well-being and need to take time to worry about me for awhile. He did too. We each needed to climb down from our cloud of bliss and figure out who we were and what we wanted. We would not survive if we grew to argue and resent each other, something had to change.\\nThe second step was actually owning it. In these uncertain times of isolation and the pandemic at large, I was forced to think about myself. I had to look in the mirror at all my mistakes and negative thoughts and just own it. Let go of judgement and how uncomfortable it might make people feel. I had a lot of unresolved issues with my mum and family that I had hid for so long. I was unravelling, there were tears, laughs and a lot of pain. I was unravelling, but I was feeling the best I’d ever felt in a long time.\\nIt was time to spring clean. Get rid of social media that was damaging my current mental health. Of course I couldn’t get rid of it so decided to change the vibe. Post more positive quotes and ideas. Talk to old friends, lessen time I spent talking to friends who were negative. I literally spring cleaned my room, got rid of clutter and rubbish. I let go of items that had no purpose in my life anymore.\\nWe accept the love we think we deserve. I deserve the best and he deserves the best, but the best of each other. If we don’t love who we are how are we supposed to love someone else.\\nEvery day that we were not talking, every day that we spent not seeing each other. I spent it thinking of him. Love is not easy and it isn’t a one size fits all either, but it is patient and kind, it is not jealous or greedy. I believe love is the union of two complete souls. Two people who have become strong and independent and can stand as equals.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 5, 'question_author': 'Jonathan Millien', 'question_title': 'How complicated is it to love someone when you don’t love yourself?', 'no_of_view': '2,016', 'answer_count': 5}\n",

People who are struggling for self-acceptance are *always* confused about what “self” means. 100% of the time. It’s not that your “self” needs acceptance, it’s that you need a fresh understanding of what “self” is and what being yourself means.\\nThat’s not a knock on acceptance — there is certainly a place for acceptance on this journey, it’s just that what you’re accepting is not your “self”, what you’re accepting is the human condition… invariant truths about life that we’re all subject to.\\nFor example: everyone has an ego: a set of self-concepts constructed automatically by the mind and defended by psychological mechanisms. That’s part of the “human condition”, and accepting that it applies to you means accepting that you have an ego and it wants to validate and defend itself. Furthermore, it’s part of the human condition that people routinely get tangled up in their ego so that they can’t distinguish between “self” and “ego” — that’s another thing worth accepting.\\nBut none of that amounts to “accepting myself”, because that all involves seeing more clearly that you aren’t defined by the things that you need to accept.\\nAs for when-and-how for me, going back to your question, I typically point to Sept 7, 2014 as the date when my understanding of this topic mostly cleared up. Which is not to say that I “accepted myself”, of course.

Was he diagnosed? If not, I’d like you to rethink why you think he is one. If your boundaries were being stepped on, and you weren’t getting any respect- which is why you think of him as a sociopath, ask yourself why you’d still like to be with him. What’s your motivation? many times in toxic relationships, there is an idea that “I can save/change/rescue him with the power of true love”. This idea is utter bullshit. If he is a sociopath, or even a garden variety narcissist, changing him is above your pay grade. Even world famous psychologists cannot change them completely even when the patient wants the change.\\nSecondly, love doesn’t always mean happily ever after. Sometimes, love means letting go of someone so that they have the time and space to heal. If you stay in a toxic relationship, the toxic person gets the idea that it is okay to be toxic, and doesn’t really have the motivation to question themselves or change their life. The drama of a toxic relationship feeds their sickness and they get worse, not better.\\nSo, if you truly love him, ask yourself this: Do you want him to be sicker because of you?'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Amy Keeton', 'question_title': 'I realized my ex is a sociopath and I still love and want to be with him.

You have had a bad break up recently and are really heartbroken. While you loved the sensation of being loved and cherished, the enstrangement hurt you really bad and has made you scared and running for the hills. Making you want to believe that you are better off alone and running away from the fear is not the solution, trust me. I have been in the exact same place as you are. I craved for a true lover again, yet I rarely let people into my life and come close to me. Deep inside, I knew it isn’t the solution, and so do you. Start fighting and facing your fears. Give yourself time to heal and move on. Let yourself enjoy and embrace the good, as well as the bad parts of being in love.\\nYou are insecure. This could be because of how you look at yourself as a person, could be a result of a past relationship or scars. It could be an outcome of anything. You need to know that everyone has insecurities and flaws. You need to come to terms with them, and you need to realise that your “true” love will accept them for who you truly are.\\nIn my opinion, there is no way of actually running away from a desire that comes naturally to a human being. It is a part of being human with feelings and desires and expectations. We are driven by the need to be loved, supported and cherished, to being an important part of someone’s life. You can ignore it, live in denial, try to be heartless and go on pretending like you don’t need someone.\\nThat, however, is never the real truth. One would always choose love over emptiness and loneliness. Please note, I am not going as far as to say that one isn’t self sufficient. One is perfectly capable of being happy with themselves, one doesn’t necessarily need a partner in order to be happy. Yet, throwing away the opportunity to meet someone wonderful as a consequence of being in denial hardly seems fair.\\nYou just need to conquer your fears, realise what you truly, really want. What your soul really wants, and it will all start to fall back into place.\\nPs: I know the above things sound like they are easily said than done, yet I have been in this position several times. I have had a chance to be in love more than once, and have been heartbroken and helpless and in denial too (denial being my favourite coping mechanism), yet things always fall back into place. I learnt to have faith in what I really want and am still in the process of facing my fears and insecurities. I hope you do too.\\nHappy Quora-ing!'}}, 'no_of_follower': 4, 'question_author': 'Anonymous', 'question_title': \"I can't run away from the desire of having a lover, but I don't want to have one.

If that is your boyfriend you are going to have to be willing to set clear boundaries with your family, and be prepared to cut off or minimize contact if they won’t respect those boundaries.\\nIt really depends on how deep into their beliefs they are, what it will come down to in the end is whether your parents religious beliefs, and, more importantly, enforcing your adherence to those beliefs, is more important to them than having a relationship with you. In my case my parents picked the former without even batting an eye, but that doesn’t mean that’s the choice your parents will make.

I\\'m going address the 50 year old as “you\" and you can take it or share it as appropriate.\\nIf you are open to love, your demeanor will show it.\\nIf you have given up and closed your heart, your demeanor will show it. Your choice.\\nThere are couples still finding each other and falling in love in their 80s and 90s. Only half a century are ya? You\\'re just getting started. And remember, you brought some good things to the table, so to speak, for your most recent relationship to last that long. You are still you.\\nI\\'m not urging the necessity of relationship (and if the breakup was recent, you\\'ll need time for yourself, to process your thoughts and feelings). I\\'m saying whether you CAN find and love another has more to do with choice and attitude than chronology.\\nSociety does have harsher standards of appearance for women, I get that. Unfair but true. So…\\nThere are things you can do to improve and preserve your looks, beginning with health. Clean diet, losing any bad health habits, exercise in fresh air, hydration, good sleep, coconut oil in your food and slathered on your body until it soaks in, preferably daily, enough sun, avoiding unnecessary chemicals in your body and on it… and so on.\\nHealth is also, perhaps even more, about your heart and mind. It flows from the inside out. A woman who is happy and confident within herself will be more resilient physically and emotionally, and far more attractive than otherwise. Suggestion: the first thing you can do is to review what you have learned along the way, and who you have become and whether you want to change anything or not. Give yourself time - after seven years together, you probably need at least six months to a year to reset and get comfortable being you. In a relationship, we often lose too much of ourselves and need to find the true Self again.

This is why video games are so popular. Virtual reality (or dreams) are a world where we have more control over outcomes. We get to rig the game. Who doesn’t want that? We feel no pain, can ignore problems and postpone life decisions. But be careful, drugs do the same thing. Spend a designated amount of time dreaming or doing what you like but schedule in other things here in reality as well. You don’t want to miss out on paying bills or interacting with loved ones now, those usually bite you down the road.\\nSchedule some creative time as well, here in reality. This may help you not feel like “real life sucks” so much. I like to build in 2 hrs a week where I clear the table and just sketch as the evening sunlight pours through the dining room window. I started about a year ago, self-teaching myself on YouTube (there are thousands of videos on this). They don’t even have to be that good, but I heavily recommend it. I sketch trees, cabins, mountainous landscapes and design weird little homes made out of new materials or ideas. Doesn’t earn me a cent or really do much for the world but its a major stress reliever and very healthy for my mind. It’s also a way to bridge the gap between reality and fantasy.\\nCreate something with an idea and story behind it. Sometimes I draw something like a castle with soldiers outside preparing their camps and tents for training or little villagers in a marketplace exchanging goods. I like to imagine what they’d be talking about, the sports they’d bet over like knight duels and the bar maids debating whether men were worth the trouble! Merchants desperately forcing their goods in your face and a plump friar perusing the area for a listening ear. Put in details like the old bearded man sitting on a barrel smoking a pipe and dozing off, a scruffy dog moving from table to table seeing if any vendors will throw him a piece of meat and a large cook chasing off a couple of kids poking around at the cakes on her table. Find something and have some fun with it.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Vichayut Roengkarn', 'question_title': 'Is it normal if you love staying in your dreams more than reality?', 'no_of_view': '462', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

Like a bad anime. Id back up to way before this guy even has anything to react to.\\nNoone actually puts someone's hand on their tiddy outside of cartoons. That's dumb and it happens way too often in bad fictional romances. And why the hell is she crying already? If she's trying to get busy, she should be in that mood. Noone cries when they're horny, and noone's getting overwhelmed with emotion before anything of impact even happens. You can have her well up a little bit afterwards as they come down during the pillow talk as they discuss what this means going forward (if she's the really weak, overly empathetic, cliched, and agonizingly boring type of female character) because that is the climax (lol) of the emotions she's been building up. A sequence of events directly lead to that point, she’s not crying out of nowhere on step one.\\nAlso this isn't how shy people act. They generally don't offer their heart, vulnerability, and body all at once when its risky. That’s a bold move, not a shy one. It'd be more gradual, with actual tact, because they are uncertain or fearful of a negative outcome.\\nAs it stands...she doesn't seem to have any agency. Just another boring, laughably overly-vulnerable plot device just throwing herself to the whims of another character with power over her. A real human would attempt to retain some measure of control over the situation. Take what you have here and pace this farther apart, have the ILY come either in an earlier conversation that eventually leads to this (that’s her boyfriend, this is a natural conversation to have), or after they do the deed when its already blatently clear that they have something deeper and she has less to lose by revealing such a thing.\\nAs for his reaction, it depends on where you want this scene to go. He can react a number of ways even with a fixed moral alignment. You need a gameplan first, otherwise it's just bad fanfiction. Do you want them together? Then he likes her and goes for it. Do you want conflict? Then he doesn't like her but goes for it anyway to protect her feelings, and is now torn and has to deal with that. Is he unflappably good? Then he kindly rejects her and she has to accept that. It all depends on what you, as the writer, want out of this and how it relates to the greater narrative.\\nCharacters serve the story, not the other way around. The way this is setup it sounds kinda shoehorned, you may not even need a romantic subplot if you dont have plans of doing anything with it (if you did, you wouldn't be asking this). Does this even have a real, meaningful impact or is she just another generic motivational plot device for the other character? If it's the latter…just spare your reader and put her on the bench where she belongs so you can focus on actual characters.\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Anonymous', 'question_title': \"What should a good and responsible guy do if his shy innocent girlfriend leads him to a romantic hay shed and there she hugs him and kisses his chest, unbuttons her white dress and puts his hand on her breast saying 'I love you so much' with tears?\", 'no_of_view': '524', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

How can you tell? When our loved one does something that triggers our fear or our hurt, we become upset with them, often getting angry or threatening to leave them. This is total self-interest and has nothing to do with love. Love is an action .. not a feeling, and certainly not a feeling of being attached to someone.\\nThe Buddhist concept of love and compassion deals with slowly developing awareness through meditation, and gradually becoming able to extend that “being in the moment” to our daily living activities. And rather than focusing on ourselves, we are striving to be aware of everything .. both inside ourselves and outside ourselves. And responding to what we see others needing .. helping with kindness and generosity. And for our own uncomfortable emotions, relaxing with them and accepting them and then refocusing our awareness off ourselves. As opposed to the selfish nature of romantic love, Buddhists strive to be unselfish in their awareness, their attitudes, and in their chosen actions.\\nI do want to comment on attachment. It is not desirable to attend to our attachment too much since life doesn’t always meet what we want, and then our attachments become the cause of our suffering. Just as being attached in “love” to a person always ends up causing us pain at times. The other thing to understand is that even for an enlightened person (we are taught .. I cannot speak from personal experience), our attachments, aversions and desire never go away. What happens is that the person changes how they react to them .. through awareness, relaxation, and acceptance, these emotions no longer get their hooks into the person and no longer control the person. In fact, apparently the enlightened person can be quite amused at the presence of attachments and aversions .. and their failure to control the person. So you don’t get rid of these things … you “reframe” how you respond to them.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 0, 'question_author': 'Anju Lama', 'question_title': 'Buddha always said that love and compassion to all beings, since we are not supposed to be attached with any thing how could be possible to do love and compassion other being?', 'no_of_view': '238', 'answer_count': 2}\n",

I can tell you something , just put it in your head and think of it casually , don't get over think and burn yourself .\\nYou said that he respects you and always makes you appreciated , then it's a hard thing to get such love , which include trust,respect and appreciation together in these days. So try to feel him and change yourself.\\nThe second point is , try to convey your feelings to him, if he is a good guy he will surely help you to figure out things and make the relation living.\\nFigure out what is the reason of not having passion to him, is it because of his misdeeds or behaviour or because of other issues related to you , may be over tension for something else like studies, family problems , your health issues, etc. Think over it and figure out is it worth missing a good guy like him or facing such issues alone….\\nAnd trust me, if he is a genuine guy and you are ready to accept his opinions also , you guys will do well.\\nThe final point is, if nothing works for you and now too you got no passion for him, then you should quit because for him , if he really loves you, can understand that you have no passion and it will kill him emotionally.

Those hormones tend to affect individuals differently, with some being affected earlier than others. Although, given our current cultural evolution, we have social expectations that take into account our discovery that full cognitive development is not attained until the mid-20s; which has led to laws indicating that minors are incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse, even though fully capable of reproduction. This addresses the difficulty that a female of 15 would have in raising a child, since hunting and gathering for sustenance has been replace by a more technological work place. Having a child early-on will affect education, and education affects one’s entire life, by the quality of one’s spouse, personal income, and opportunities for offspring.\\nWhat you can do is be aware of the problems that can be associated with early sexual activity, like being victimized by a predator, sexually transmitted disease, and pregnancy.

I looked for him in all the men i dated in school and after and could not connect to any of them the way I felt I should. When I saw my twin I knew instantly. I asked him many times where do I know you from ? I gave him my phone number and he contacted me right away. For almost 6years i have been on a rollercoaster with him. Times I was with him I wanted to cry out of pure happiness of being with him . Being in his arms is the happiest safest place in the world. I l love him in a way I can't even begin to explain. His presence near me just emotionally makes me feel that I am whole I have my part that has been missing all my life. With out him I feel lost like part of my heart is missing I can't get him off my mind. He knows how I feel and doesn't need to ask me . Its his security . Security meaning there is no need to to say anything he just knows his space is there. Even if I'm not. He needs to have the space . I need the same from him . Space created for us will build us as it should . Space is a must They NEED THEIR SPOT in your life. His space is there always has been always will be. The spaces we create for each other make up our magic and our fantasy land. Simple easy no complexity Just space to be us together.\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 6, 'question_author': 'Anonymous', 'question_title': \"Have you ever loved someone before you truly knew them, as in really loved them for as long as you've known them and not understood why?\", 'no_of_view': '932', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

He won't see what you're talking about.\\nI agree with the other person who answered, and that is seek out couple's counseling for your marriage in dealing with this. Even if it's through your local church. Find a marriage counselor. It's that unbiased point of view, and advice that will reach him. He needs to hear how you feel, and how they've treated you in that environment, so then maybe he might be more open to seeing how it is rather than the rose tinted glasses he chooses to see his family through.\\nI've been in this position, please seek couple's counseling for both of you, and your sanity. Please don't let years pass, get this help as soon as you can so you don't have to suffer. Your spouse might be their son, but he's a grown, married man, and they need to respect you, and the boundaries you and your husband decide.\\nHe's not going to see it without professional help. If he does, it will take years and years… Please start seeking that help, so you don't waste years, and have your marriage fall apart. This is your and your husband's life, not their's.

The reason for this statement that both me and my friend have had experience in distance relationship. Not with each other, but with different people.\\nWhile I had to struggle daily to keep the moods up, and that was because the lady and i had never spent sufficient time together, My friend dated my classmate since college, and they're due to get married this year. Or i think they're married already, I'll have to confirm.\\nWhat happened in my case: I had hardly spent any time with my partner as she left for medical college in abroad. The only awkward thing that kept our desperation going, was the conversation between us. Later it didn't work out for us because my work was impacted and our families didn't support our relationship etc.\\nMy friend had ample time to spend with her lady. Her families supported them and they could withstand the long distance relationship, for over 5 years (the guy is in usa and the lady is in india). This could happen because they had spent some time already and this i believe helped them to get through the distance constraint.\\nI was a non believer that long distance relationship works. But after seeing my idiot friend and his fair lady, i am thinking that they did it right. I used to ask my fried whether he had any affairs during all this time. He said it never happened to him. So therefore, the qualities you have in a person matters too. Personally, i never tried to look for an affair until much later in my long distance relationship. The reason for that could be that I was more unhappy and desparate about my long-distance relationship rather than being happy about it (there was nothing to feel happy about, i had to struggle daily just to keep someone happy on a different time zone, Obviously it couldn't have lasted for long..) So, do it right and make it a point to spend time with each other (physical presence, not digital) whenever the distancing gets to you and makes you feel insecure.\\nI wish you luck, friend.

Many of us are isolated from those we love and care about because of health concerns. Those of us who are polyamorous may feel even more isolated, since we are probably limited to what partners we can interact with. Us solo poly folks and those who are just dating may not have access to anyone for intimacy or sex. Self-care is important and making sure that not only our physical, but our mental and emotional health are taken care of can be daunting. Add to that, the desire to make sure our partner(s) are taken care of and we may become overwhelmed. What do we do? How can we have healthy sex and intimacy in a time of social distancing?\\nNow I realize that much of what I’m going to talk about requires funds and we don’t all have access to do what it takes to do all of it. However, if you’re reading this, you do have internet access and while physical sex and intimacy may be unattainable, social media has made it possible for us to interact in sexy and intimate ways. Self-distancing doesn’t mean zero contact, it just means zero physical contact. Get creative! Find ways to connect with those you desire by other means than in person.\\nMost of us are familiar with the five love languages, words of affirmation, time, gifts, acts of service and physical touch. I suggest we start with these. Identify what your love language is (it could be a combination of several. For me it’s time and touch) and what are your partner(s) love languages. Then find ways to fulfill those needs without physical contact (yes, touch is the hard one). For those of use who are isolated, letting our partners know what we need is imperative. What follows are a few ideas on how to get through all this. Share the ones that resonate with you with those who love and care about you. If you aren’t sure what resonates with them, ask. Request that they participate with you in creating a long-distance intimate and sexual connection.\\nWords of Affirmation: This is pretty easy. Taking the time to send texts and messages telling your loved ones how important they are to you is a given. You can also go old school and send them a letter or card detailing your desire and love for them. Use programs like Marco Polo to send videos of you speaking to each other. If they enjoy dirty and or sexy talk, make a recording talking to them that they can play during masturbation.\\nTime: This means quality time. Find things you can do via social media and other platforms. Playing games, watching movies, watching porn and spending time together, even if it’s online can be enriching and fulfilling. Have meals together, via Skype or Zoom. Set the time and dates and stick to them.\\nGifts: While it may seem difficult to give gifts while being distance, remember, Amazon (and others) still deliver. Send cards, small gifts and things you know they’ll love to them on a regular basis. They don’t have to be expensive, just things that resonate with them.\\nService: This is a little harder, since much of service is about being physically present. Many of the previously mentioned ideas can constitute service. Also, you can do something like order dinner and have it delivered to them. If you’re not in total lock down you can bringing them dinner personally. And if you are in total lockdown you can make gift certificates of the things you’ll do for them when this crisis is over.\\nTouch: This is the hardest of all. And where you can be the most creative. Mutual masturbation, with verbal descriptions of where and how you are touching them. There are some sex toys that can be operated remotely. Buy each of you one and take turns controlling the toys. Send virtual hugs and strokes on a daily basis. This is one time where it may be appropriate to send explicit photos (with permission of course).\\nAnd, don’t forget to take care of yourself. Self-pleasure is more than jacking off. It’s taking time for a long bath. It’s being intimate with yourself, by watching a sexy movie, reading a book that turns you on or even meditating on sex and sensuality.\\nThese are just a few ideas to keep the sex and intimacy alive while dealing with the pandemic. Sex and intimacy in the time of the coronavirus is possible, if you’re willing to step outside of your preconceived ideas of what constitutes sex and intimacy.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Anne Corbe', 'question_title': 'How do you sustain a relationship under COVID circumstances?', 'no_of_view': '731', 'answer_count': 5}\n",

They didn't had a proper conversation for a few days and after sometime she told him that she is marrying a guy who is earning 15LPA and she also added “TBH money matters”.The guy tried to manage the situation but nothing worked and finally she got married forgetting her 7years of long relationship.\\nEg.2. I know a girl (my senior) who uses tinder for evening snacks…yes you read it right “for evening snacks”. She matches a guy just for timepass and then she blocks everyone once she uses him\\nI know some girls will say “it's her choice”😂\\nIf you really want to find your true love make sure you are rich and don't make insta or fb's quote fool you…looks and money matters in a relationship.\\nP.S - I have started using quora recently so there can be some mistakes in writings..and ya “criticism are welcome 🤗”\\nraman_raihan\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Pavan Kumar', 'question_title': 'Do you think few girls treat love as a time pass or a backup option?', 'no_of_view': '838', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

In the original it was, “if one cannot be both.” It is a bit of literary hyperbole and may have sounded different in the Italian anyway. Obviously governments don’t count on love (as Orwell said, “No one is a patriot about taxes”) though on any given occasion they may cultivate it with varying techniques. Likewise nobody can rule through fear alone for very long, and if they try to they have to put their all into it and write off any desire not to go down in history as monsters. At the same time no state can afford to go without the sanction of fear; even small towns need to put drunkards in a lockup from time to time. However to see what he meant explore how governments use “love” and “fear”. Love is not the same as “romance”; “popularity” is a better description. Other words come along like “consent” and a few others. Even dictatorships need some degree of consent. “Fear” is better described as deterrence as except in blatant tyrannies and not always there, people don’t fear the state all the time. And a well-managed state will have procedures predictable enough to ensure that people in it’s domain know what it wants. For it’s own good as well as for it’s citizens or subjects as fear of an unpredictable threat creates desperation whereas a state that respects a normal persons desire to live a normal life will only need latent fear.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Anne Privashe', 'question_title': 'Who originated the idea that one must be loved or feared to be revered as a leader?', 'no_of_view': '441', 'answer_count': 3}\n",

Sex? Well, if that’s all you want, then I suppose you’ll get whiplash from turning your head around to look at all the hotties that appear before you.\\nSex has become disposable. Meaningless. It’s a commodity and a social status tool.\\nPeople give their bodies away. Or they sell them for peanuts.\\nBeing used and abused physically is no longer seen as a source of shame but as a confirmation of one’s attractiveness and desirability.\\nSo if all you want is to bed as many willing ladies as you possibly can, well, go ahead, then, I suppose. Have fun with that.\\nBut for me, there can be only one.\\nNo, I’m not naive to believe that there’s only ONE “the one”. But even if there are a few out there for me, it’s a big world, so the chance of running into them during my lifetime is exceptionally slim. I would either have to get extremely lucky early on, or else I’d have to give up and perhaps settle for “less”.\\nExcept, I don’t settle for less. I don’t jump into bed with just anyone who’ll have me.\\nA woman could be looking like my wildest dream come true; sex on legs, and I wouldn’t give a shit if she didn’t have those other qualities I seek.\\nAnd what are those? Well, I can’t deny that good looks are a nice bonus.\\nBut physical beauty fades over time. Not to mention that, the more beautiful a woman is, the more interest there will be in her. So regardless of whether I’m secure enough in my own manhood or not, the reality is that she’ll be the one who has to deal with a constant stream of offers from horny men. And with lots of choice comes less responsibility…\\nI’m not saying that all beautiful women can’t be trusted to stay faithful, but it’s like buying a really expensive, flashy car. Everyone wants to ride in it, and you can’t park it anywhere, because it’ll probably be stolen while you’re away from it.\\nNot that it matters much because my taste in beauty has never been the glamorous model type. I can appreciate extraordinarily beautiful women (and men) not to mention the sheer effort and time that many of them put in to look like that, but the woman I want isn’t someone whose greatest priority is her appearance.\\nIf she’s beautiful to me, that’s all that matters. She could be considered plain or boring by everyone I know, and I couldn’t give a flying fuck.\\nAnd that’s because her beauty, to me, isn’t the makeup or the clothes she wears. Nor is it her popularity or her professional success and income.\\nAll I care about is how she makes me feel.\\nI need a woman who makes me feel wanted. Someone I can trust.\\nSomeone who’s responsible when she needs to be, but also able to relax and be silly.\\nA woman who doesn’t back away when I show affection for her, but instead feels worthy of being loved by me. A woman who can give as much as she gets.\\nI’d like her to have her feet firmly planted on the ground, but her head shouldn’t be afraid of visiting the clouds.\\nI want a real woman. A loyal, faithful, trustworthy and equal life companion.\\nSomeone I can put my life in the hands of and gladly put my own life on the line for to protect.\\nA lover, a partner and most importantly, a friend.\\nThat’s what I want.

We had gotten him and a bunch of other chickens from an old lady who couldn’t care for her flock any more. He was small, as bantams are, weighing only one pound, tops. He was mainly red-orange, with dark primary feathers from his wings and a golden chest, as well as an absolutely beautiful tail.\\nThis little guy was a total dork. He would come to his name, and enjoyed being held by a human more than he enjoyed spending time with other chickens. He loved sunflower seeds and Roly Polies (Pill Bugs); they were his favorite food.\\nHe was a flirt, showing off his pretty feathers to the pretty lady chickens, even though they were bigger than him by at least five pounds.\\nHe was good at showing his dominance, when a new rooster showed up, Biscuit would put the newcomer in his place, using his small size to run under the other and attack from behind. (Note that this is not cock fighting, this is just two roosters displaying dominance and figuring out the pecking order)\\nBiscuit had a brother. Another bantam rooster, in equal size to him. This brother, Teddy, was only different in personality and chest color. While Biscuit had a gold chest, Teddy had a rich brown one with black dots. Teddy was a bit more aggressive, and was protective of his girlfriends, challenging your hands and feet to battle.\\nOnce, Biscuit got sick, shivering and not eating or moving. We took him in the house to help him get better. Teddy became sad, looking for his brother, and Biscuit didn’t seem to get better. So we put Teddy in the box with Biscuit, hoping that he’ll get better. And he does.\\nI think that, on that day, the brother’s love for each other saved Biscuit.\\nOne day, when I was closing the door to the chicken coop, I noticed that Teddy was gone. I run into the house and shout to my mother that I cannot find Teddy.\\nFor an hour, we look for the tiny rooster. Till I look at the stock tank we had set up for the ducks. Teddy was in it, floating lifelessly.\\nI let out a cry of horror, yelling, “NO!” and scooping the poor baby from the water. Mom rushes over, plucking Tedds from my hands. She pushes on his chest desperately, muttering under her breath. My father sighs and takes my mother’s hands away from the chicken’s lifeless body. He had drowned to death.\\nWe buried Teddy the next morning, with a fresh dew on the morning grass. Biscuit is obviously distressed, clucking worriedly and not crowing as he usually did. I hold my baby boy for hours, crying into his feathers and apologizing. He was sad, so, so sad that he could not find his brother. Devastated.\\nWe recover from his untimely death, begin talking about him with pained smiles. My family is very close to our animals.\\nYes, chickens can feel love. They sure can.\\n_after bit_\\nThere was a large rain. my brother had gone to put up the birds. Biscuit wasn’t in the coop, but instead struggling in a puddle he had become trapped in somehow. My brother brings him in the house, soaking wet and tired from flailing about. I hold my son in my arms, in front of the heater, warming him up and drying out his feathers. Soon, he’s feeling better and stronger. I give him some sunflower seeds then put him out in the coop for him to sleep. To think that Biscuit could have died by water as his brother did scared me.\\nTwo weeks after my dog had passed, Biscuit went missing. He was never seen again. I was absolutely devastated.\\nRIP Teddy, ???- 2019\\nRIP Biscuit, ???- 2020'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Andreas Badi', 'question_title': 'Can chickens feel love?', 'no_of_view': '233', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

Maybe they\\'ll get manners, but probably not. Do not let it keep you from giving both to yourself and others.(My Father once said about my Mother: she\\'s toxic to you and so is your brother. Drop them! My FATHER said “get them out of your life, about his former wife and only son! And he meant it. I ended up writing a note to my brother saying if all he did was send a birthday and Christmas card, two days out of 365, he should save the money and leave me be. This past Christmas he sent money to a charity I support. I didn\\'t reciprocate. A few years later I went to see Mom. I walked in said ‘hi mom! She said ‘You\\'re too skinny. I thought ‘Oh great, I got this Mom today. I went back out and started the car. I came back in and said “hi Mom\\'. Guess what she said. \"Your\\'e too skinny\".I went out, came back in, said ‘hi Mom and for third time she said I was too skinny, I left. It was my birthday. I grabbed the birthday chocolate chip cookies on my way out.\\nMy relationship with my mother was always fractious. When I saw my mother again with me as a grown up I said to her: be careful what you say to me. You only get three chances…two months later she let her real self slip and went after me. I said “ok, you\\'re new at this. We can hug and put it right behind us or you can consider it #1. She chose #1. I went in my room and read for the night. In the morning she said “is it still #1?” I said yes. “The numbers never subtract unless there\\'s one hell of a huge reason to.” Several years later I was selling her house. She was asking 189. I said “no, you\\'re on the bay, and the yard is fully landscaped, 389. She got 356. A thank you for me doubling her income? Nope. Selling her next house I had a huge money making question for our realtor. I got out “but, Ron, do…and she made the zip it motion across her mouth! I was 40 not 4! The literal side to side zip with the eyebrows too. Oh boy. I excused myself and apologized to the realtor and went outside. He was very kind and said people get emotional about these things. What was your question? I told him, l had costed out a huge sunroom running the length of the house for very little money that would have doubled her money again. When he left, she came out and said what was your question? I said “that\\'s two\". And took a walk. The third? “You\\'re too skinny\" and I even gave her three chances with just that one sentence. I said “Ok, that\\'s three\". I didn\\'t see her again until a family meeting to discuss her terminal illness. She amazed me by asking if I could be there really often. I said “Me??? You hate me!” She said “Yeah, I do, a little, but you always tell me the truth and you have lots of backbone. So my whole point in this ramble is be true to yourself, surrender your ego and quietly and purposely get on with the good and shake off the bad. No matter how many times you have to count to three.

This will only highlight the mistake the wife has made by marrying her husband.\\nThe reason I make these observations is that it generally comes about as a 3 sided relationship, both the mistress & wife get very little out of it, if there are children they get even less from this unbalanced set up, unfortunately the children are always the ones that pay the price from the loss of time with their father, which is wrong & has an effect on their development..\\nThose people that think that this is an acceptable arrangement have I would suggest got to take a long hard look at themselves, as it's truly selfish & unfair to think that a three side relationship is something that they can get away with..\\nThe fact that they think they can do it without any repercussions or paying the price for their behavior towards those they're supposed to love is also very questionable, which suggests they have a serious character flaw which is a huge problem\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 2, 'question_author': 'Maurabie Mendoza', 'question_title': 'Is it true that if a man loves his mistress, he would be proud of her and show her off to people?', 'no_of_view': '674', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

Those actions will certainly make the admirer feel drained and lose self-esteem. They may feel like they’re lying, or they may simply want reciprocation and wonder how much they have to do to get it.\\nThat’s not love.\\nOr it may be that your partner has low self esteem and everything you do or say isn’t enough, so you start feeling like you’re not being a successful partner.\\nOr maybe you’re deeply lonely or want a sex partner or need to be “with someone” for social status reasons. That’s something springing from within, but the self esteem issue itself is the issue; it will invade other aspects of your life.\\nThere are other ways that relationship patterns can need adjustment.\\nSo if you are feeling like what your partners have required is draining and erodes you’re self esteem, you may want to reevaluate entirely.

Every idea they add to their lives is built on a foundation of being worthless.\\nThe foundation doesn’t evaporate when they leave home. People who have been damaged in childhood can spend years in therapy trying to dig out and replace their foundation with healthier ideas. The problem is everything they built on top of that rotten foundation is adapted to the foundation. So just replacing the foundation isn’t enough. Everything above it needs to be adjusted. Which is why it can take an adult a lifetime to repair the damage done in childhood.\\nSome people, for various reasons, can reject at least some of the lessons from their parents. Very often they have some other stable, sane adult in their life who provides the foundation they need and allows them the perspective to see their parents are wrong. But not every abused child has that. And they — and all animals with an extended childhood — are wired to depend on stable parents who show they value their child to grow up psychologically healthy.\\nOften parents who were abused as children get triggered when their own children act in ways that the parent would have been beaten for. Their children’s behavior creates intense anxiety in them. They need the behavior to stop. But the only way they know to stop the anxiety is the way their parents stopped them.

Hell, in some books i’ve read, she Clark was Superman WAY before Lois caught on. Then again, they did grow up together.\\nThese two have literally fought each other over Superman’s affections back in the Silver Age.\\nBut aside from these two, let’s move on to some others.\\nLori Lemaris\\nProbably one of the strangest of Superman’s love interests. Why? We’ll come back to that after some backstory. Clark first Lori back in college when they both attended Metropolis University and he helped her stop when she lost control of her wheelchair.\\nThey both started dating each other.\\nOne day, they both visited an aquarium where there was an accident and Lori ended up in the grasp of an octopus. Now you would think that’s bad, right? However, both Lori and the octopus remain rather calm about the whole situation. Soon enough, the octopus lets her go and swims away.\\nOf course, Clark rescues her and she just makes up an excuse about him scaring it off.\\nLater on, Clark even worked up the nerve of proposing to her (way too soon dude).\\nYeah, Clark, one small problem with all that…\\nNOTE: This is what i was talking about earlier\\nSHE’S A FREAKING MERMAID!!!\\nYes, that’s right people. THE MAN OF STEEL HOOKED UP WITH A MERMAID.\\nYeah, it turns out that Lori was sent by her people to view the progress of the surface world and her time was up, so she had to head back.\\nAlthough they do share one last kiss tho.\\nAs a side note, she even appears in the Young Justice cartoon!\\nMaxima\\nMaxima is a alien conqueror from the planet Almerac who travels to Earth to make Superman her mate, deeming him the only man worthy of her affections. She first appeared in Action Comics (1938) Issue #645\\nHowever, her time on Earth did soften her up more.\\nShe also appeared in Superman: The Animated Series which was part of the DCAU (DC Animated Universe).\\nAnd that just leaves us with one more lady: New 52 Wonder Woman.\\nHell, even in the Kingdom Come storyline, Superman and Wonder Woman end up getting hitched and have kids of their own. I’m aware that Supes and Wondy hooked up in Dark Knight Strikes Again but WE DON’T SPEAK OF THAT BOOK. At least i don’t.\\nI probably missed a couple of girls but as of now, those are the love interests that Supes has had over the years.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Labib Hasan Kafi', 'question_title': \"Who are Superman's love interests?\", 'no_of_view': '1,465', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

And i thought this went for me dating anyone else…and Its been 23 years. It was something huge over two people wanting to date, fuck and figure out if she loved him as much as he loved her. So if this guy wanted to talk about love then he must have been serious. She used aliases which confused me…Zaineb Ali/Kristi Ruiz…Jessica and her name is Yesenia Kristen Vega now we are in our forties and i wrote to the FBI about these White Power neighbors trying to enforce Jim crow laws and extort my biological family to fund the Klu Klux Klan but I haven’t received any response…it was her birthday party and my high school faculty and friends were trying to make amends because since i was a child these white power neighbors and police have told the schools to change my A’s to C’…and I should have been Salutorian while the sister who was adopted with me and molested me to help this extortion and coverup of their killing my uncle Cesario Rodriguez Jr an undercover Police Officer among other crimes to extort money from the Media so the KKK being part of ‘the network’ (al Queda) could carry out terrorism to get the USA out of the middle east, bring the holocaust to the USA, and slavery back to the world…But in high school she would walk by my English Class with a smile like looking at me was pleasant… and when i think about her…but these people were serious and I wanted to publish these books to create a beautiful life for Yesenia Kristen Vega and I…but as a kid many of the neighbors and people outside my family taught me my body is worthless for sex and love because of kidney disease and the subsequent kidney transplant…I wanted to figure out what happened before I moved on and I don’t like being told i have to marry the adopted sister who molested me or i have to obey jim crow laws or marry into the family of the White Power neighbors who are extorting my biological family and covering up Caltrans murders (they sold the assault rifle and used my name to frame me) the murder of my uncle, my cousin Charlie…various other acts of terror they would just use my name and the police would help them cover it up because they wanted some of this fairytale money…but holding a gun to someone’s head and saying if they ever date or marry isn’t a joke. I was lucky to kiss Yesenia Vega and I would be lucky if the Police, FBI or Justice system investigated anything of what I say and allow me to marry my Rainbeau or know she and all our families are safe and i could try dating someone else. but talking about love on your first date is huge many people would be lucky…I hoped to lose weight and some miracle pill would help my manhood increase by 5 inches and put a ring on the lady’s finger and a smile on her face when i publish my books and they hit bookshelves…I wanted to talk about marriage like when i was 5 I told her that someday i would marry her…and as that sister walked me home she said never go back to the Vega home because they are evil…and I was shy and people are supposed to trust their family not molest them and help assclowns extort their biological family. Stella and i used to play Simon Says and she would cheat because Yesenia and I would laugh when she made the raspberry sound with her tongue.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 2, 'question_author': 'Charlotte Ben', 'question_title': 'My “date” said when we meet we can talk about love.

Although not necessarily in the same way that humans do, but research has shown that elephants do have high level emotional capacities, which is very clear through their actions.\\nFor example, elephants have been found to stop on their migrations and mourn at the sites of deaths of other elephants from their herd, even when years have passed since the death. In some instances, elephants will remain in these positions for days mourning their loss. I don’t know if that would be called ‘love’ in the way that we think of it, but I definitely believe it indicates an emotion along those lines. And they can definitely feel it for humans too, as can be seen in the response of elephants towards the person who saved them years and years ago.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Andreas Badi', 'question_title': 'Do elephants feel love?', 'no_of_view': '231', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

They have established a permanent binding schedule for such activity.'}, '0': {'date': 'Sep 30, 2019', 'user_name': 'Dave Nelson', 'upvote': 7, 'view': 265, 'answer': 'I currently have two pets (a cat and a dog) and have had three more (two dogs and a cat) that have passed away. I’d say there are three things that make me love them as much as I do. In no particular order, those three things are:\\nTrust. They trust me and I trust them. It isn’t just me that thinks so. I’ve had a number of vets over the years and each one has commented that when it comes to uncomfortable exams and procedures, my pets look at me and if I say it is ok, they let the vet do what she needs to do. It isn’t just letting vets do what they need to do. There have been a few occasions where my dogs have been attacked and I have jumped in to save them. When there is a threatening situation, my dogs stand behind me. I’m the alpha male by default - I’m 6′4″.\\nLoyalty. As much as my dogs are very social and play with the neighboring dogs, when it comes to a human taking them for a walk away from me, that will never happen. I was in the hospital for a few days when I had my first dog and a friend came over to take her for a walk. They knew each other for years. Natasha was excited to go but stopped at our mailbox. She would go no farther in case I came home. I received my second dog (Calico) when her owner moved. Before that, Calico would run away from her first owner fairly often when the avalanche canons would go off in the town. She ran away to my house where she would be safe which was about a mile and a half away. The cannons were just as loud at my house but she felt safe there. My current dog refuses to let me out of her sight. She is always waiting at the window for me. One time I had to be away for about eight hours and she let my aunt she needed to go outside. When my aunt called her back in, she refused. Instead she went to the front of the house and waited at the top of the driveway for me. My aunt wasn’t mobile enough to go outside to get her. My cats show their loyalty by hiding when strangers come and sticking by my side all the other times. The loyalty isn’t a one way street. Years ago I got a new job in a different state. I had two dogs and a cat at the time and knew it would be difficult to find a house to rent with that many pets. So we would be together, I bought an RV and the four of us traveled halfway across the country to our new home. We lived in an RV park for several months until I found a permanent home.\\nAffection. Cats have a reputation for being aloof but that hasn’t been my experience. Both the cats I’ve had (Little Guy and Kitty) have been very affectionate. Sure you cater to their needs but they give love in return. It is funny thinking about it. Most of the day a cat will be off on their own. But in the evening, they come out and sit on your lap or put their head on your arm and then when it is time, follow you to the bedroom and share your bed. Sure they are gone by the morning (most of the time) but it is the thought that counts. As for dogs, well everyone know they are affectionate. If I’m not snuggling them, they are snuggling me.\\nTrust, loyalty, and affection. You can’t ask for much more.'}, '69': {'date': 'Feb 2, 2020', 'user_name': 'Janice Pennington', 'upvote': 1, 'view': 13, 'answer': 'They love me. They entertain me. They are there for me.

The smartest thing my wife and I did in our marriage was maintain separate finances.\\nI have my paycheck. She has her paycheck. I have my bank account. She has her bank account. I am responsible for bills A, B, C, and D. She is responsible for bills X, Y, and Z. I could not tell you for the life of me how much she makes on a paycheck, or how much money is in her account. It is none of my business.\\nWe both respect each other’s financial contributions this way. Because I cover mortgage, electric, gas, and water, she knows that the home is always taken care of. No utilities get turned off. It’s just something she never has to worry about, despite the fact she knows that it costs real money.\\nIn contrast, she takes care of things like cell phones, internet, and groceries. There is always food on the table. I know she does her share. I don’t question how she spends her money.\\nUnless the marriage is sustained by a single income, the concept of “our money” is what causes the fights. Both people feel entitled to use it. Both people have different ideas what it should be spent on. Both people feel upset if the other party uses the money for something else instead. Running it as separate finances, we have had exactly two fights about money, both of which were the same.\\n“Can I get some extra money from you for X bill?”\\n“Sure.” *shares money*\\n*Immediately notice 200 things the other person is spending money on that is either not bills, or is clearly in excess.*\\n“Now I am angry, because I gave you what little discretionary spending money I have leftover after my bills, sacrificing my own ability to do X-thing-I-enjoy, and you said you needed it for bills, but in reality you only needed it because you overspent on Y-thing-you-enjoy. I must skip lunch for the week, but in exchange you were able to go out to the movies. This is not a fair arrangement.”\\nSeparate finances allow each person to do their fair share. Separate finances allow each person to still do things they enjoy as well, provided they can budget properly. I know that during the summer, if I turn the Air Conditioning up 1 degree, it costs me X extra dollars, so I ask myself, do I want to spare that money, or do I need to save that for this alternative expense.\\nWhat most people want to call “financial cheating” is typically just one party feeling as though they are more entitled to the money than their partner. Whether it manifests in hiding money from your partner, lying about expenses, or spending money without telling them, it ultimately comes down to the idea that one person thinks they should have greater control over the money than what their partner does.\\nThe reality of money is this. There will never be enough money to do everything you want to do. When it comes to money, whether you’re living on social security or whether you’re a millionaire, your wallet is no match for your imagination. There will have to be some decisions where you say “We can’t afford that.” Friction starts in the marriage when one party keeps on giving up what they want, and the other party starts to have greater control of the money so that they can get more of what they want. This is not about money wasted; it can be very real and challenging decisions, such as “There is not enough money for both the electric bill and the groceries. How will we cut one of these two very essential bills down?” But if both parties do not 100% agree, then there will be problems.\\nSeparate finances. When my wife came home with a brand new car, I couldn’t get angry with her for wasting money. It was her money. Her paycheck that she worked for, and that she balanced out while taking care of all her other obligations. Good for her. She scrimped and saved and budgeted and now she has something nice to show for it. In contrast, my car is a heap of junk, but I got our mortgage paid off 15 years early, because I hate being in debt. Separate finances makes each individual accountable for what they earn, what they spend, and how they budget. No more sense of being entitled to your partner’s money. No more fighting because your spouse doesn’t agree with your priorities. Two people who help each other financially by carrying their fair share of the expenses, but who also allow each other to see direct personal benefits from efforts to budget, save, and sacrifice.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 3, 'question_author': 'Dustin Darby', 'question_title': 'How frequently are couples financially cheating on each other?', 'no_of_view': '905', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

I already knew some of the members from attending the last two sessions.\\nDavid walked in, surveyed the scene, and headed straight towards the seat next to me. We were sitting on adjoining sides of the corner of the conference table (L)\\nI thought the subject matter—four of Plato’s Dialogues—to be turgid, and had read only two. The discussion moved along vigorously nevertheless. I loved being at a literary “salon” on a Saturday afternoon.\\nMost in the group agreed to meet afterwards at an Italian restaurant for an early supper. As our informal procession wound its way downtown at winter dusk, church bells rang as if on cue.\\nI took a seat at one end of the long table. David found the last seat, at the far end on the same side. We weren’t in each other’s sight lines or hearing range during the entire meal.\\nBefore dessert, the person next to me had to leave, and within moments, David grabbed their place.\\nI continued with the animated conversation with the folks at my end of the table, at the same time aware, without looking at him, of the quietly patient gentleman next to me. But he didn’t break into the conversation—and after five minutes, he moved to get up and leave.\\nI put my hand on his elbow and said, “Don’t go yet.” My words—or my touch, expressing recognition—perhaps enough to make him reconsider.\\nSoon after, everyone got up, not quite in unison but close enough.\\nOne explained, “Meeting some friends at seven.”\\nAnother, “See you next time, this was great!”\\nA third, “Have to pick up groceries before the market closes.”\\nAnd within minutes, we were left alone at the table for ten. The waitress asked us if we wouldn't mind vacating; she had to clear the table for the next party.\\nWe moved together to a high top table near the bar, as if we were a couple. That familiar feeling astounded me. It just happened, so naturally.\\nDavid politely asked if I had time to stay, not assuming anything. I replied, “These were my only plans, to come to the meeting.” I would have otherwise gone home. I had no one to account to. No one was expecting me there, like before the catastrophe.\\nA fact of my life now, a widow after forty-one years of marriage.\\nWe ordered coffee. I don’t know what he noticed about me, but I focused on the metal rims of his glasses in the warm light of the bar. We ended up going to an early movie, an unusually creative animated feature film from Brazil.\\nBefore I exited his vehicle to get into mine, I noticed his hand resting on the hand brake. Noticed, and stared. He asked for my contact information. Being a member of the group, I trusted him.\\nEven before I walked through my front door, a text from an unidentified number lit up, “I enjoyed your company. Would you perchance be free next Friday?”\\nI was surprised. But at the same time open to surprise. I called up a friend and described the evening’s events, then asked, “Marcia, have I actually been on a date?” After all, the last time I had dated was before I was married.\\nHer answer, something like a quick “Hell, yes!”\\nThen this was my first date in forty-five years, at the age of seventy-one.\\nBut I had plans to visit my daughter in New York City that next weekend and texted him in return to “get in touch” after that.\\nIs “Let’s stay in touch” actually code for “I’m letting you down politely but it actually means I’m not interested. No need to call me.” I was unschooled in modern protocols after being married since 1972, a lifetime ago. My courtship back then began with my roommate’s boyfriend who she ditched for another guy, a concert cellist just returned from a European tour (but that’s another story).\\nWould the nice gentleman know the codes and conclude I was “ghosting” him? That was a disagreeable term I had heard from my senior friends experienced in online dating.\\nMaybe I blew it.\\n(to be continued)\\nPhoto courtesy of Pixabay\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 3, 'question_author': 'Janet Hodson', 'question_title': 'Did you ever think you would see him again after you first met?

The activities may not always end in sex. You might just be flirting non-stop, dancing provocatively with strangers, as well as kissing and making out with random people. The phase helps you find out your likes and dislikes in a partner; you get to explore your sexuality, and know yourself better”. Just because “hoe” is attached does not mean it is only ladies that get to experience it. Men too are involved.\\nSo, here is the reason why I think every young person deserves to go through the hoe phase.\\nThe phase is necessary for everyone that is naturally curious and adventurous because you would always seek something more; you would always wonder what is at the other end of the tunnel. And the only healthy way you can do that is to explore when you are single with no responsibilities of being a wife or a husband. The fun part is – you get to do all these on your terms. You get to fuck, flirt, make out with whoever you want.\\nI feel like some naturally inquisitive people don’t explore much and then they become husbands and wives and boom, they discover that they should have experienced more people; they wonder if they would have met someone better if they had explored. They try to satisfy their curiosity and in the process, they cheat.\\nSo, why not mingle with as many persons as you want now that you are single?\\nAnother reason why I think every young person should go through the hoe phase is this – it is a great opportunity to discover yourself, explore your sexuality and know what you like and don’t like in a partner. I’d use myself as an example. From the few guys I have mingled with, I have a better understanding of my love language, I know how I want to be touched and made love to and I know the qualities I like in a partner.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nRead more here.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 3, 'question_author': 'Ann Sarafina', 'question_title': 'Do you think young people must go through the “hoe phase” before they finally settle down with one partner?', 'no_of_view': '6,196', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

So ....I was in lots of pain ans I attempted to deliver something I foolishly thought she was to give her something she would understand and that was to say hurtful thing that were untrue to cut deep like she had done to me I never was so upset in my life it was worse than losing my mom so I sent songs to be an asshole and a few were new things I discovered of music we shared when we were together music made us happy and can bridge lots of memories feelings and emotions.

Perhaps. Did it make a difference in the relationship? Yes. It destroyed it.\\nThings you could do:\\n-Move to her country. This one is tough because moving to different countries all the time can be really tough itself without the hardships of a relationship which probably are there if you are considering moving to her country. I mean if everything is perfect, whynot stay where you are? Do not ever expect exceptions from sociological paradigms in a relationship. If for one second the thought even crosses her mind that you won`t fulfil your responsibilities as a spouse or lover then she will leave you instantly. 99.9% of cases. Then you have the headache of having to move to another country to chase after another girl. Sorry if you find yourself in that situation.\\n-Determine if she really likes you. Is it really worth leaving where you are?\\n-Find another girl. This one takes time depending on how strong your emotion or idealisation of the girl is. You know how men are though. Women tend to be more committed to longer term relationships. It’s the way of the world. Still times change and people change, so maybe you might actually be very committed to this new love of yours. Time will tell-you more than anyone else.\\n-Use long distance strategies. Find closeness in a lack of closeness. Later on in your relationship depending on the type of people you are, you could actually sadly be apart from your new love more than you think. Maybe she has other priorities. Maybe she values you less than other things. Maybe she doesn’t like long distance and wants it to end but can’t express herself the right way because she is too emotional or irrationally neurotic or confused. You can value this though and maybe it is better to get exposed to in a long distance setting. Every opportunity like this is an opportunity for you both to make amends and well develop your love for each other.\\nI sincerely hope you find love which is long lasting. I am blessed to say I have had a lot of short term flings with a lot of women. All kinds. That is paradise for a young man. There is a point of diminishing returns in terms of satisfaction though. In the long-term these cause satiation and I personally found that you start to value more than just sex because you have had sex with so many women.

The first month was great. Great sex, lots of attention, and I felt great! Then I found out she was making other guys feel the same.\\nIn another instance, I was single and pursued another woman I felt was quite attractive. Well she was very attractive, but didn’t have a great personality. We often clashed. We barely began dating before I got sick of her.\\nWhile in another relationship, a woman who I deemed to be a bit less attractive than my current partner caught my attention. We met as friends, joked about hooking up and having wild sex adventures. Let’s call her Linda. After having a meaningless argument with my then girlfriend, I left and ran to Linda. We had wild sex, but it wasn’t long before we realized that our sexual desires were incompatible. Or rather to be clear, I didn’t want phallic objects inserted into my anal cavity.\\nLast but not least, while single yet again and on a dating sight, I connected with a VERY VERY attractive woman. She was an actual model. I didn’t think it would go anyway, but shot my shot anyway and it worked! The problem there was she was frequently traveling, so I wouldn’t see her very often. She also traveled with her male best friend who was also a model — really cool guy. I later found out that she did not cook what so ever, so anything she ate was cooked for her or she ordered. She was also the type to run away from conflict, so when we had a disagreement, she’s change the subject and run away. But the straw that broke the camels back was when I was hanging out with her male best friend one day. In the midst of hanging out, he bent over to get something and his boxers caught my attention. Jokingly I said “Those boxers must be popular, Gina wears that same brand from time to time.” He laughed and said “she needs to stop stealing them from me.”. Ummm what?!\\nLong story short, she’d frequently wear her male best friend’s boxers and shirts, especially to sleep in. When she told me she had feelings for him but he would never act, I took my leave.\\nMoral of these stories, the grass is not always greener on the other side. You’ve put in the time and effort to get to know your current partner. You know many of their likes and dislikes, you know mostly how they think and how they’d react, and you’ve worked to build a foundation. Why trash all that to try your luck with someone you know nothing about except that they’re attractive?\\nHear me out. It’s like playing BINGO and having 4 spaces filled with 1 to go to make a straight and completely line, then throwing your BINGO card away to obtain a new card to start again from scratch.

Morally, that includes threesomes, polyamory, and egalitarian polygamy.\\nMorally, I feel when most folks say “polygamy,” they actually mean “polygyny”—a system where men can have multiple wives, but women are forbidden to have multiple husbands. History shows us that polygyny is invariably oppressive. A system that permits men to have a range of action forbidden to women is not moral.\\nThere are two different systems of morality: compassionate morality and Big Bully morality.\\nCompassionate morality is based on empathy and understanding that morality is about not hurting others unnecessarily. If three adults enjoy having consensual sex, and everyone’s happy, it is moral because it doesn’t harm anyone.\\nBig Bully morality is the idea that morals come from lists handed down by an authority, whether that’s Joseph Stalin or God or a person who says he speaks for God or the State itself. Big Bully morality says if the authority tells you it’s immoral, that means it’s immoral, period. If the authority tells you that sex has to be between exactly one man and one woman who are married, then any other kind of sex is wrong. If the authority tells you that it’s morally wrong to let a witch live, then you are morally obligated to kill every witch you find.\\nBig Bully morality is the more primitive morality. It’s the law of the jungle, literally. It’s the law of the chimpanzee troop. Whatever the lead chimp says, goes. Might makes right, and the mightiest decide what is moral and what is not.\\nCompassionate morality is the Golden Rule. It’s human morality. It’s based on the idea that other people might not make the same choices I do, and that’s okay.\\nI believe threesomes, polyamory, and egalitarian polygamy are moral because my moral foundation is compassion, not “obey whatever the strong say.”'}}, 'no_of_follower': 6, 'question_author': 'Matt Gold', 'question_title': 'Morally, how do you feel about threesomes, polyamory, and polygamy?', 'no_of_view': '1,452', 'answer_count': 3}\n",

Have you told her how you are grateful for her and what she contributes to the family? Have you asked her about what she is grateful for? Having a right attitude makes such a huge difference. Perhaps having her make a list of what she is thankful for would help her be more grateful. I heard a mom say that when she was growing up that her dad was a very positive person. He didn’t tolerate complaining and if one of them had something negative to complain about the other sibling they had to first say 3 positive things about them. That kept her from complaining quite often because she didn’t want to praise her sister for 3 positive qualities. What a fabulous idea!

I’ve been there. I was in my 11th grade(she was then in 12th) when I started crushing on her. I’m in 12th grade now, and as you might have inferred, she’s in another place right now. It all started when I asked her out in my 11th grade. (Yes, I asked out a senior because I felt she was cute ik I was being delusional.) After I did, she immediately came to me an hour later during break time and said she’s not interested (aw sad).\\n(NOT REALLY)\\nI said ok and we decided to just be friends from then on, but it didnt kinda work because I was in 11th she was in 12th we rarely got time to meet in a college like mine. SO instagram and whatsapp, and later I got her number.\\nWe were irregularly texting kinda lot on IG, she didn’t have any intentions with me at all. But I had many. As days progressed into months, we talked about stuff that got me more interested in her.\\nNow, this is where I started liking her more and more, but she never gave any clue as to the fact that she’d never want anything to do with me, and my feelings intensified but I never really told her about it because she didn’t give any clue in the first place. We met like twice or thrice but we didn’t really connect, but I still liked her so much that I didn’t want her to get any signs that I liked her, only because she said she wasn’t interested. Kinda counter-intuitive I know, but it iz what it iz.\\nSo what happened?\\nPreparatory exams came to devour us. We straight up stopped contact. Any form of contact. After our preps, seniors had their preps, and then their board exams. She kinda fucked up her board exams, and I got to know this through someone else. So I thought this was my chance to talk to her and uk, maybe tell her its okay and everything.\\nI did, we texted again and talked on phone. There was really no connection at all between us, except I used to joke here and there to reduce the weirdness (I was good at that) and I didn’t want to tell her I still like her despite her rejection, because I knew I wouldn’t be able to swallow the fact that she’d say we don’t connect or something like that. This is the kind of pattern that fucked me up.\\nLater, after her boards she got her results, wrote competitive exams and went to another place. Just like that.\\nI expected her to say something to me, stuff like thanks for everything and other emo shit. But the thing is, she didn’t have to. Why should she? For all she cares, I was just another acquaintance.\\nWhat I learnt through all this is, whenever you’re having any form of contact with your crush, you should let them know what you’re feeling about them, atleast a little hint. I know it sounds corny, but it is what it is. Atleast that way, if the feeling isn’t mutual, you’ll know soon enough and your heart can think about some restructuring, however hurtful it is.\\nBut if you don’t, if you hide it up, you can’t move on JUST like that, unless like in my case, she moved away, because like the saying goes, “out of sight, out of mind”. Truer words have never been said.\\nOther general stuff to move on exist, like listening to good old sad songs, rock songs, psychedelic songs, COLDPLAY, Tame Impala, working out, finding a new hobby, etc.\\nAlways better to rip the Band-aid off in a fucking second rather than stretch the time till your heart can’t take no more. Trust me. You’’ll start to affect your own life and those around you, unintentionally, it’ll take a toll on your potential, abilities, personality, the whole A-Z up to a point where you feel worthless. This shouldn’t happen. So go talk to her, give hints, if she isn’t picking up on them, it’s not because she’s not able to understand, because she does. She’s just not that into you. (WADDUP MOVIE REFERENCE GOALS lol)\\nYou don’t deserve to be experiencing one-sided love, no one does. It hurts like a classic Indian parent belt whip. Man the fuck up and face it. You can do it. There’s so much more to life if she says no. So much beauty and essence in this world to endure.\\nFocus on you, and yourself only.\\nAtb!'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Aakash Dhar', 'question_title': \"How can I move on from my crush?

But your boyfriend is the most truthful guy you will ever come across. Mark it. It's appreciable what he told you by being open or reckless or angry or anything. But he told you what needs to be told. That is something that you won't have with most men.\\nAs to your confusion regarding why? It isn't something complex to be asked a question about. Likewise, it isn't something that needs to be answered. But I'll answer nonetheless. He lost his feelings. Whether that is sexual or emotional. He lost it.\\nAny feeling, whether that may be love lust or anything, is way too powerfull that guys will commit themselves to the source of their feelings life long. But feelings fade away too. And the rest that happens is comparatively boring. So it is a fantasy that both of the sides weave a story about, and then try to act the fantasy out in regular life.\\nThis is a natural law with men. Even if you argue about a case in which the guy’s feelings haven't faded, then the time limit for their feelings is too high compared to others. This is something that you have to keep in mind.\\nYou haven't completed the second part of your question. But I'll answer nonetheless. When he settles in your city, be like you usually be. There's nothing that will change except your sheer self deception to which you subconsciously subject yourself by comparing your memories which you label as your 'past' to your present. I repeat, you regard subconsciously your memories as your entire ‘past' even though your memories doesn't constitute 1/10 th part of your life, and then compare it to the present.\\nSo sort things out like how he did. By speaking truth by being truthful to your guy and yourself. Then you will get yourself back with less pain and mess. But instead of sorting out, out of your tension if you demand same emotion from him in the name of whatever it is between you, you will make mess. I repeat it is mess. It isn't solution to sort your problem that you are seeking if you are aiming at mess. And if you are aiming at mess, good luck with that because that doesn't work.\\nHaving said all that I would like to advice you not to become hopeless or anti-love or anti-men. It isn't because he hates you he said that. It is because he noticed, I repeat, it is because he 'noticed' that he isn't being truthful to you he said that.\\nSo, all that happens depends on you. Choose a way less painful. Put a proposition that satisfies you both. Then slowly get out of touch if you can. Choose a way less painful. Good luck.\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Larissa Kwong', 'question_title': 'its unhealthy to a relationship to be asking these questions so im editing it out and in effect removing all traces of it.?', 'no_of_view': '1,313', 'answer_count': 2}\n",

I was born in Pakistan, but moved to America as an infant, and was raised a normal “American” kid in Kansas (minus my disability, but that’s another story). Although I speak Urdu, I don’t read or write it. I’ve seen the inside of a mosque maybe five times in 52 years, and have celebrated Christmas, Easter and many other cultural holidays since I was a kid. I was never raised with much religion - my parents tried - but even they are Muslim light at best. But, I was raised to love and respect all cultures.

I love mom and dad a lot - they’re celebrating their 56th wedding anniversary next week and I still talk to them at least 3–4 times per week - but my life decisions are decided between my wife and I, not my parents.\\nThats the key - if your boyfriend is already telling you that there’s too many cultural differences to be together, what he’s really saying is he doesn’t have the strength ability or intention to stand up to his family and his parents and tell them that you’re the one for him.

I’ve gotten to know a few Pisces folk and one pattern I’ve noticed is that when it comes sexuality and attraction, they’re pretty open and fluid. Meaning there’s a good chance they won’t be straight, especially Pisces women.\\nMy best friend is a Pisces and I feel like I know her pretty well. When we first met, it was very obvious there was a mutual attraction. But once we actually started talking is what made it deeper. We talked about spirituality, the universe, astrology, suicide, depression, the weird and fucked up circumstance in which our parents met, we were just open and vulnerable.\\nNow, I also wanna make it clear she didn’t fall in love with me. We got to the point where there was heavy sexual tension, but it wasn’t acted on because she had a boyfriend. Not gonna lie though, this is what brought on my first moral crisis.\\nIf you wanna get a Pisces woman to fall in love with you, learn her. Learn her love language, learn what makes her feel seen, learn what it means to her to be sensual because you’re definitely gonna need in your back pocket. Pisces is a highly sensitive water sign. Sensuality runs through the blood of us water signs.

I don’t know if that’s how it is for most water signs, but so far, that’s the way it’s been with the water signs I’ve met and myself included. Giving her a massage or foot rub while she tells you about her day, running your fingers through her hair as you guys watch TV together, stopping on the way home and getting her favorite candy or book just because. Shit like that is what you gotta do, but it has to be authentic. You gotta do it because you actually want to, not because you’ve got some ulterior motive other than seeing her light up.

Nobody will ever love anyone unconditionally, otherwise everyone would find love. You have to be smart, funny, handsome, healthy, fun, rich, good with kids, good with people, good, good, good. And if you fail to meet those expectations, it's time to move on. Everyone wants the best possible partner and given the opportunity for someone “better”, most people will take it. And you're not the only one. It happens to many people. I bet some of your friends have gone through the same thing. I would advise to not put too much emphasis on a partner especially in the short term. Life sucks and then you die, so it's not all bad.

Hart', 'upvote': 3, 'view': 119, 'answer': 'DOES TRUE LOVE EXIST? 8 REASONS IT MAY OR MAY NOT\\nSo the early passionate and heady days are passing and you think this one is a keeper. Your love seems to be blooming in all the right ways but how do you know if it is real love and when will you know that?\\n1. TRUE LOVE IS NEVER JEALOUS OR POSSESSIVE\\nReal love is utterly selfless, it is about putting that other person before you and your needs and above all else. It shouldn’t even be a conscious decision, it should just happen naturally.\\nThere is no room in actual passion for possessiveness, jealousy, management freakery and selfishness. Don’t confound overpowering focus and claustrophobic control with selflessness, it certainly ain’t that. Managing another person is borne out of low self-esteem and warped inclinations and is also dangerous territory. What might seem complementing initially can develop insidiously into anything deeply hazardous and will be eliminated at all costs.\\n2. TRUE LOVE IS ACCEPTING PEOPLE FOR WHO AND WHAT THEY ARE\\nAs part of the controlling debate, true love does not seek to change someone but accepts them for who they are, what they are, how they look.\\nThere may be no problem with wanting to look great for the guy or wanting to impress him, attaining that job campaign, aiding a member of family out. Really rightly, he must be very proud of you and also its perfectly regular and normal to wish to elicit thoughts of respect and satisfaction within your fan. However, one person trying to modify another, modifying their habits, anything they appear like, who they see, is just not about really like but manage.\\n3. TRUE LOVE IS NEEDING NOT WANTING\\nIt’s easy to confuse need with other feelings in a relationship. You want to be with your lover 24/7, is that desire or need?\\nRequiring or becoming clingy is a adverse feeling based on fear and insecurity. It may result in possessive and suffocating behaviour as destructive tendencies raise. This can be totally opposite to seeking someone in your life.\\n4. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS\\nLove is about what you say but words can be cheap, we have all been in a situation with a guy who promises the moon and the stars but then just doesn’t seem to deliver, is never there when you want him, is unreliable and thoughtless and lets you down.\\nReally like demands consideration and function, it must be nurtured to be able to increase. That euphoric Cloud Nine sensing won’t last forever and actions – fantastic and straightforward – are definitely the mortar that positions the bricks together and constructs one thing strong and long-lasting.\\n5. REAL LOVE HAS MYRIAD FORMS OF EXPRESSION\\nOne reason really like is very hard to establish is it manifests in several kinds. Enjoy continues to be depicted in five really like different languages within a book titled, The Five Enjoy Languages by Gary Chapman.

Physiologically this is how it works.\\nIf you believe as I do, that everything is somehow connected, or related — there is something about that — that should follow through in our make-up — in how we are, how we think and how we act, our roles, as distinct male and female counterparts.\\nMuch as females don’t do the insertion (I blush), we also shouldn’t do the chasing and I don’t know about other females — but I certainly feel like I degrade myself when I do this (and I have done it). I simply don’t feel good about myself.\\nIf I had a daughter, while I wouldn’t advise her to make it extra difficult, I would say TIT for TAT.

But the main advice is, you have to disentangle yourself from this toxic person. It’s going to hurt, but it’s going to hurt a lot more if you keep her in your life.\\nFirst, the legal problems. Was the marriage legally recognized, by a marriage certificate or equivalent? The law doesn’t care if the marriage was secret or not. If you do have a legally valid marriage, you should legally divorce, because otherwise you are still entangled with this person. Depending on local laws, you might not be able to date other people without being accused of adultery, which means you might end up having to pay your ex a lot of money. So, I’d start there. If it wasn’t a legally-recognized marriage (but was recognized by the Hindu faith as being valid), then I’m not sure what you have to do, as I don’t know what the rules are concerning divorce in that faith.\\nSecond, interpersonal: basically, you should break off contact, and look for somebody else (after taking care of any legal/cultural prohibitions against seeing someone else). Getting dumped really sucks, I’ve been there. But there are other people out there. You just have to move on.\\nThird, cultural: are other people going to look down on you because you are in this situation? Here I’m not so sure what to say, because I admit I’m not really familiar with your culture. But I will say, if you think that you have an accurate analysis of the situation, trust that analysis, even if you are being pressured to see things differently. Again, hard to do, but you have to trust the fact that your family, friends, or priest will not be in possession of as many facts as you are. They won’t know what that relationship was really like.

Balancing both energies in one self is a hard task, specially when we are caught up in daily obligations such as work, social activities, social status pressures and other worldly ‘necessities’ - we tend to forget or ignore to checking in with our ‘self’.\\nSome of us at some point realize that life is not just about all things material, thus start to seek for meanings. We then look inside ourselves, searching for mirrors to reflect in order to find/recognize our true purpose of living in this material world.\\nSometimes we find these mirrors in others - parents, children, friends/foes, bosses, colleagues, other relatives, even in a perfect stranger; sometimes we find them in humbling religious practices and/or our experiences.\\nYet even if we see & reflect on others or things outside of our ‘selves’ it merely brings us to some level of intellectual understanding. Some are satisfied at this point, some will feel like there’s still something missing.. like a hollow deep within, hence the feeling/the longing, the need to seek for logical answers for pure truth. The answers are too deep within, it requires us to dig to the core to find the love - for the ‘self’ as is, without any materialistic conditions and/or attributes. Practicing kindness, patience and faith for ‘self’ will be challenging. (Fyi, am so tempted to go further but nah).\\nOur chance of meeting a TF is narrow. No one should expect to be ‘handed’ their perfect mirror. This ‘perfect‘ mirror is both a ‘gift’ & a ’curse’ - depends on how one would perceive it to be. It could be a gift only if we are willing to use it to see beyond our outside appearances/conditions & observe so deep it bleeds & hurts til we find our life scars and the valuable wisdom in it as the true gift, not just the mirror; it could be a curse if we are blinded by the illusion of its perfection & perceive it as a material gift - we can’t see the usefulness of it (there are plenty other ‘mirrors’ in this world), and this so-called perfect mirror only reflect & highlight the ugly features of myself, etc.\\nA catch 22.\\nIf looking deep into what reflected in the mirror (for the rare some it’s through their TF) to loving your self is ‘devil-like’ & so vain, then perhaps don’t look in any mirror at all. Hide in the shell and under the shadow. Nothing wrong with it. What we do to & for ourselves in this world is fully our own responsibility.

There isn’t such a thing, so I’m not sure I’ve got any feelings about it.\\nIf you mean a person will only get attracted to you, by using the phrase “True love,” I’m afraid you’re sorely mistaken. People tend to develop crushes even after getting into a successful relationship. So that “perfect soulmate” myth is banished.\\nThink about this, there are some for whom their partner means the love to them. But sooner or later, they break-up with them. If it was true love, would it have broken? No, certainly not. That’s what you call “Infatuation,” and it is common in teenagers, who don’t know the difference.\\nIt doesn’t mean there aren’t people who don’t care, though. But that comes after ages of being and knowing each other, usually among elderly people.\\nOne more thing: technically, “True love” is possible, though maybe not in your preferred sense of the word. Parents love their children more than anything else in the world, and would do anything for them.

It is written in the traditional Shakespearean (or English) style of sonnet. It contains three quatrains and followed by a rhyming couplet. The couplet section is the portion that this questions is about.\\nLet\\'s walk through a brief summary of the three quatrains before we address the couplet.\\nQuatrain 1: The poem begins by addressing the beloved, whom the entire poem relates. The beloved is being compared to a summer\\'s day. Shakespeare says, \"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,/And summer\\'s lease hath all too short a date:\" In this, he is saying that love and summer both are fleeting and can easily be shaken by \"rough winds\" that come their way.\\nQuatrain 2: Quite literally, this section says that sometimes summer (and love) are too hot and can decrease the beauty of the beloved. In the line, \"And every fair from fair sometime declines,\" discuss the changing course of the season. Quite literally, the change from summer to fall (the change of love in youth to age). He says that nature will not halt these changes.\\nQuatrain 3: \"But thy eternal summer shall not fade,\" the beauty of the beloved shall never fade, like the real summer does. In the eye of the speaker, the beloved shall always be beautiful and lovely. And, the beloved shall never find death or lines of age.\\nShakespeare sums up the sonnet, in the rhyming couplet, by saying that his love will exist for as long as humanity exists, and that while his love will be universal through time, it will also be the perpetuating force that drives humanity. Considering that, as we know it, the concept of love has been around since the inception of humanity, the logical progression that it will thrive throughout humanity is not that far of a stretch. The flattering motion produced by Shakespeare isn’t really that love is immortal, but rather that his love for this one person will be immortal, and the springboard for love to come.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Stephanie Aceves', 'question_title': 'In the poem \"Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer\\'s Day” What does the ending couplet say about the relation between art and love?', 'no_of_view': '571', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

The moment you break someone up from a partner they truly care for is the moment your crush becomes a obsession. That being said, you should never wish for a relationship to end but if it does you could try. My advice is wait at first. After getting out a relationship she almost certainly doesn’t want to immediately go back into one. This process varies from person to person. It could takes weeks for one person and years for another. But what you can do is provide emotional support in a truly friendly way where you care for her emotional repairing and well being. After she seems like she’s ready for a relationship I’d say just ask. She likely has a deep connection to you and at the very least has a why not mentality to this. From this point on it purely varies. But there is some advice I would consider universal. DO NOT force her to do something she doesn’t want to do. That goes for any person ever. Don’t rush things, taking it slow is the most efficient way to do things. Most importantly in my opinion, be her best friend along with boyfriend. Listen to her, provide her emotional support and always be there for her when she needs you most.

Let me be perfectly franc about this answer. You simply don’t love anyone you have just met and telling them so is a lie! After 6 months it is still a lie! After a year it is still a complete lie! Love is something that takes time and trust and knowing someone thru and thru, right down to the bone. So, what you are confessing is nothing more than hormones my dear. Being horny! Or at least if you are truly sincere, liking someone. After five years, looking someone in the eyes after making love and you know you know that person and you tell them from the bottom of your very being “I love you”, then maybe you are getting a little closer to actually being honest about it! Don’t be a desperate little girl, who gives your love to the next best thing over and over, like it is the cheapest thing you can give. Love must be earned through trust, so make your love expensive, but keep your friendship and cheap…'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Anonymous', 'question_title': \"Is it a gud idea to confess to someone I've just met?\", 'no_of_view': '834', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

But sometimes you get some girl who has a hard time expressing her emotions or telling you that she loves you so that would be her way of saying it. But that's not very often. Girls can be complicated, but usually there's something we're uncertain about. We're not that complicated. I recommend talking to her, in general and about that subject. Talk to her in a lot.

Loved this on CD’s back before streaming. Have watched it again at least once. The whole series. S2E2 is particularly disturbing.\\nCoupling. The original BBC version. Funniest show ever written.\\nPerson of Interest.\\nSherlock. BBC version w/Benedict Cumberbatch\\nSherlock Holmes. BBC version starring Jeremy Brett. True to the original stories, probably the best Sherlock ever portrayed.\\nFoyle’s War .. (BBC) this was my “i dont know what i want to watch” series. just take in another episode. So well done. by the time I finished, I started all over again.\\n[Edit] and MASH. I used to watch MASH reruns years ago, and I would still watch MASH reruns. Even with my SO. excellent show.\\nHey .. whats with all these BBC shows? Well.. because even the worst BBC programs are better than 80% of American crap.\\nBit of trivia: Steven Moffat wrote both Coupling and Sherlock.

Such approach was the most effective as against them as their perception on love as fits for the weaklings only. This explains why verses of obeying and fearing God plentiful in the Quran.'}, '0': {'date': 'Apr 15, 2020', 'user_name': 'Khairi Naser', 'upvote': 2, 'view': 103, 'answer': \"It is mentioned from hadith that Allah loves us at least 100x as much as our own mothers, and you know what that means. They’re relative numbers I don’t have a way of measuring this but you get the point.\\nHere are some ayats explaining a concept you might have in mind. Punishment can be a form of love, because often times people oppress other people. If Allah were to punish us in this world though, everyone would perish! That’s why we have life and afterlife which are distinct. Allah does trial us in this world though, and there are determined times. Zionism was bound to happen as mentioned in the quran, and it is also bound to be destroyed also mentioned in the quran.\\n﴿وَرَبُّكَ الغَفورُ ذُو الرَّحمَةِ لَو يُؤاخِذُهُم بِما كَسَبوا لَعَجَّلَ لَهُمُ العَذابَ بَل لَهُم مَوعِدٌ لَن يَجِدوا مِن دونِهِ مَوئِلًا﴾ [Al-Kahf: 58]\\nAnd your Lord is the Forgiving, the possessor of mercy. If He were to impose blame upon them for what they earned, He would have hastened for them the punishment. Rather, for them is an appointment from which they will never find an escape.\\n- Saheeh International\\n﴿وَتِلكَ القُرى أَهلَكناهُم لَمّا ظَلَموا وَجَعَلنا لِمَهلِكِهِم مَوعِدًا﴾ [Al-Kahf: 59]\\nAnd those cities - We destroyed them when they wronged, and We made for their destruction an appointed time.\\n- Saheeh International\\n﴿وَإِن مِن قَريَةٍ إِلّا نَحنُ مُهلِكوها قَبلَ يَومِ القِيامَةِ أَو مُعَذِّبوها عَذابًا شَديدًا كانَ ذلِكَ فِي الكِتابِ مَسطورًا﴾ [Al-Isrâ': 58]\\nAnd there is no city but that We will destroy it before the Day of Resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment. That has ever been in the Register inscribed.\\n- Saheeh International\\n﴿وَلا تَحسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ غافِلًا عَمّا يَعمَلُ الظّالِمونَ إِنَّما يُؤَخِّرُهُم لِيَومٍ تَشخَصُ فيهِ الأَبصارُ﴾ [Ibrâhîm: 42]\\nAnd never think that Allāh is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them [i.e., their account] for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror].\\n- Saheeh International\\n﴿وَلَو يُؤاخِذُ اللَّهُ النّاسَ بِظُلمِهِم ما تَرَكَ عَلَيها مِن دابَّةٍ وَلكِن يُؤَخِّرُهُم إِلى أَجَلٍ مُسَمًّى فَإِذا جاءَ أَجَلُهُم لا يَستَأخِرونَ ساعَةً وَلا يَستَقدِمونَ﴾ [An-Nahl: 61]\\nAnd if Allāh were to impose blame on the people for their wrongdoing, He would not have left upon it [i.e., the earth] any creature, but He defers them for a specified term. And when their term has come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they precede [it].\\n- Saheeh International\\nDoes anyone else speak like this? I never mentioned this to anyone anywhere before, but reading the quran it is clearly like Allah wrote the book. When you pretend like you are someone, you make mistakes. You give generic answers. The quran though is perfectly consistent within itself. Even the fact that time is relative is recognised. Something only relevant to… Allah.\\nThis is what triggered the polytheists and pagans. Who is this Mohammed guy? Who gave him the authority to speak like this?\\nI also see a similar attitude in science where people discover something, they do tests, they’re happy, but then they stop asking questions. They stop trying to figure things out, like when people make fun of the “prophecies” in the quran about zionism and banking and this and that. They don’t address the actual thing! Life is disappointing but that’s why we have heaven.\"}, '1': {'date': 'Apr 15, 2020', 'user_name': 'AbdulKarim Kawsara', 'upvote': 0, 'view': 'error', 'answer': ''}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Anonymous', 'question_title': 'Allah is merciful which is not same as love.

I care about him I’m afraid of lies, I like my husband for who he is. He’s my entire life and entire world. I have some issues lately within myself with him and trust. I love my husband more than anyone knows. He really is all my life. I married him for the love, his eyes always been special to me. When I see I see thru his light. He’s not a small thing for me he’s the bottom of the ocean and beyond. He’s my companion and safety… at the end of the road is my husband, he’s a very good person, he’s better than me. I’m not special but my husband is quite an angel. I can always rest my head on him. I can’t wait for our kids and have a baby that is just like him. My husband loves me maybe more. I think of myself as a world in a world but he’s more than this. I care for him. He is my lifeline and everything inside my life. I fear deeply to lose him. Lol I trip out him going outside at all I fear this illness. My husband is also very cute, he’s a super cute person. For example sneeze when he’s out in the sun, lol his eyes were sparkling when he first looked at me. When he spoke to me the first time, never in my life I connected with someone the way I did with him. Before I knew him, I was jealous about nothing under the sun. Now the only thing is I feel somewhat possessive about him but I’m healthy about it. I know I care too much. I like his family a lot. I usually hate ppl easily. (No joke) but I feel at home with his family. Gosh it’s like a real match from God, since Allah was the one who brought the boy I sensed when I’m small and the boy who sensed me the girl, together. We both have healing to do. Life isn’t roses but you can plant roses. He’s a really good husband, I enjoy him and I’m interested in him, he has a beautiful heart. Ppl sometimes hate me but literally every person likes my husband no matter where we go. He’s just loving and full of love.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 3, 'question_author': 'Mark Rondez', 'question_title': 'Did you even really love your husband or was he just another stepping stone?', 'no_of_view': '959', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

Wait for what? Are there really hordes of people out there, sitting around, biding their time, with plans to “get with” someone but choosing not to until something else happens first?\\n“I really want to get with Dave, but first I have to complete my first novel, and then I’ll be ready to get with them.” I mean, I suppose if someone is really just to busy to date, they might want to wait until they have more free time. And, of course, I would very likely wait to go on a real, in-person date with someone until after the second wave that will come after the quarantines are all lifted too early. But waiting to be in person with someone doesn’t mean that the relationship can’t go ahead and start.\\nAs soon as I recognize that I have romantic feelings for a person, I mention it to them. Then, if they feel the same, we start a relationship. If they don’t, then we don’t. What would I wait for? Their mother’s blessing? A sign from a magic sky daddy? The moon rising in Sagittarius during a lunar eclipse? To what purpose?\\nIf I had to say that I waited for anything, it would be for their consent. Without their consent, a relationship doesn’t happen. But if I don’t have their consent, I don’t really “wait” for it, in the sense of them saying no and me pretending to be their friend while scheming to make them love me. If they aren’t interested, I let them go and I move on. I don’t sit around pining after people who don’t want to be with me. I just don’t *do* anything to them without getting their consent first.\\nSo, I might wait a few moments between “I really like you, may I kiss you?” and actually kissing them, depending on how long it takes them to give me an answer one way or the other.

If we can look at it from this perspective then we can make our world more peaceful!\\nLooking inside, return to innate nature and enrich our hearts are the message to talk to people.\\nFirst, we actually, cannot blame this pandemic caused by COVID-19 to all Chinese people. Everyone has a contribution to today's situation so that no one should blame each other. Things happen as human morality is sliding on the big slope. Nowadays, some people are not only bent solely on profit, but they even stop at no evil. They will do all kinds of evil things for money, and they will also commit murder, pay someone to kill, and abuse drugs. Human moral is sliding down but some of us have not realized that and even see some of them as normal. Back to traditional is the way to improve human morality.\\nSecond, why did the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) destroy 5000 years of ancient Chinese Culture? The ancient Chinese culture has spiritual practices such as Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism. But why this CCP destroy all of them? It is because of control. They cannot control people with strong faith. They cannot force good people to do bad things. Therefore, they have to suppress the good things to ease of doing so many evil things; massacre of social elites at the Cultural Revolution, massacre in Tiananmen Square, Persecution of prisoners of conscience – especially, Falun Gong practitioners – Forced into Organ Harvesting. Some of us know their evil things but one eye close, one eye open to going together with CCP. Why? We all talk about freedom and embrace freedom here in the West but why we still work with them, still give them the stage to perform and to grow. It is also because of the immediate benefits.\\nLast but not least, there so many lessons in the past such as the fall of the Roman Empire and the killing of all firstborn sons in Egypt. Why were these two powerful empires collapsed? Is this because of suppressing religious believers?\\nCOVID-19 Pandemic is part of the divine plan to help human beings repay karmic debts and destroy CCP. To be saved, we should repent to the divine with all due sincerity, admits to our faults and pray for a chance to change our way and stay away from CCP. That is the way to go, and that is the magic cure.\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Daniel Fung', 'question_title': 'How can we use COVID-19 to create more love in the world?', 'no_of_view': '356', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

( This also is the topic they usually shift when they get bored of talking, as then nothing else is left other than asking this question )\\nFuture Plannings : We all like to live in a fantasy world and most lovers like to text and make their partner dream about their future together by discussing future plans of home, kids ( this is good to make them attached to you and provide them an image that you are serious for them and also lead them to a fantasy land )\\nGossip : Girls like to gossip about things and people and mostly you can see them discussing this stuff with their better half, who listens to them and advises them about the situations they are in.( Most guys are usually not interested in this stuff but when they start listening, they start giving advices which most girls hate, they just want the guy to listen and not provide his feedback or ideas unless asked ).'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Rishi Vasishtha', 'question_title': 'What is the most common text message that lovers exchange?', 'no_of_view': '962', 'answer_count': 3}\n",

After all which men in his right mind not want a woman, who is hot and nothing’s wrong with her? People in general are so crazy, especially the hot ones, that if they can keep it together for just one night, the men already know she is a keeper.\\n100% of men does that and 100% women mess it up by not believing him when he professes his love after one night, therefore no man has ever been or ever could be in a relationship with a woman with whom he is truly in love with and she is not someone who is experienced, knows the above and taking advantage of him shamelessly and probably grudgingly even that.\\non the other hand, after the first night, if we keep returning for sex, but not else, that is because we are not in love with you and there is nothing you can do to change that for a long long, very long while. However, being our cool sex buddy is your foot in the door, your way in. If you keep being ready for sex, whenever we call you, then after about a year, we will see that we can count on you and marry you, even though we are not in love with you (99% of hot men end up doing this). On the other hand you can make yourself indispensable by being open for threesomes, and if we had that a lot for years, then we will want to reciprocate it with 2 guys 1 girl threesome, when we will finally feel the big love for you, when we see how much another quality man (someone we can look up to) wants you and how sexy you are when you are being an adult sexually mature person who is on the same level of the sexual food chain as we, but still reliable and trustworthy. This is your endgame, this is the most this life can give to a couple and it is perfect.\\n(In most cases for the 2 guys and 1 girl sex, the guys are going to want viagra if they are not bisexual, even if they only touch you. You do not want floppy accidents in front of another man and your wife, it is way better to be safe than sorry in a situation like that, not to mention the experience is mindbogglingly awesome with porn star cocks.\\nOnly get prescription viagra after consulting with a doctor (these days they advertise it as a recreational drug, and it is), but only take a quarter of a 100mg pill, that’s plenty, don’t drink alcohol with it, as it counteracts it, and the generic version called sildenafil is a fraction of the price.)'}}, 'no_of_follower': 3, 'question_author': 'Angelica Woodard', 'question_title': \"I can't take guys serious when they tell me they love me only after 2 months of dating.

A couple of thoughts/suggestions for you:\\nRespect his wishes. I see other people saying he needs to respect your decisions, but I don’t see anything in your question that tells me he doesn’t. He just doesn’t want to get hurt. Don’t bring anyone to meet him until you feel you have something solid going on.\\nExplain to him that he’s missing out on the chance to meet the people who are important to you, and that you’d rather know how well he’ll get along with them before you make the decision that anyone is the right one to marry. Perhaps he’ll consider that.\\nNow, if he thought of your ex sort of like a son, if it’s not a problem for you, you might consider encouraging him to continue having a relationship with him. Just because the guy is no longer in your life, doesn’t mean he can’t be in your father’s—unless, like I said, it’s a problem for you. If they go fishing or something, that’s not a bad thing, but if you encourage that, you may also want to explain that you don’t want the ex around you. Communication is key.\\nEncourage your dad to get out more (when it’s safe again to do so) and make friends, take up a hobby or several, and generally have a life of his own. If he feels the need to be a father figure to young men, there are many opportunities in community service that might help him to not get so attached to any one particular person you bring to meet him. It can be hard for older men to bond with guys their own age if they’re starting out as total strangers. But there are a lot of younger guys who lack a father in their lives, and if he has anything to teach/pass on, it could be a great benefit for him to go out there and try. Try to get a sense of what’s going on with your dad, and go from there in a non-threatening way.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Emy Reimer', 'question_title': \"Why can't my dad give my new love even a chance?

My guess is that you have come to see romantic attachments as a hindrance, because you have had disappointing encounters in the past, most likely in childhood.\\nThe problem is, you have needs that are going to be expressed in some manner. If you deny your need for emotional support, you will sabotage your business relationships by making inappropriate demands on your business associates. If you deny your need for healthy physical interaction, you might become addicted to pornography, or even to some kind of behavior that can get you into trouble. A need that you try to ignore does not just go away.\\nIf your parents were alcoholics, you might want to look into organizations that deal with that. If not, you might not qualify for membership in that particular club, but you will likely find another where you can belong. The important thing is to find a support group of some kind.\\nPeople like to talk about the need for openness, but there are situations where too much openness can be counter productive. For instance, if a previous employer was constantly belittling you, that isn’t something you should bring up in a job interview, though it might be worth mentioning to an employment counselor.

I recently watched ‘The Notebook' and i liked this explanation soo much.\\nI personally believe Love is wanting someone's happiness even if that happiness no longer involves you. If it is love then you'll only grow in it, love never put you in trenches. And definition of “success” is always very subjective, for some success is to have a decent home, a good job and nice family but for some others its to become millionaire and there are people like me who believe success is living each moment happily. And i feel when in love, even though it is unrequited, no one can let you down!\\nOnly you give the power to someone to break you, i have gone through breakup, i have failed in subjects but i won't blame love for that, i would blame myself for not uunderstanding the true meaning of love and successs.\\nSo to answer love never makes you unsuccessful its the false perception of it that makes you blame it for dreams that you were not able to achieve\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 2, 'question_author': 'Ezaz Akhtar', 'question_title': 'How did love make you unsuccessful?', 'no_of_view': '1,323', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

You just have to -like I said-make it PLAIN. That’s it.\\nBut do this where you are somewhere where you have your own car so you can just drive off (like in a restauarant) or if he comes over, be real nice and sweet, just lah-ti-dah walk out of your house like you’re gping out to your car, you’re going out to water some plants-maybe even get some friend to show up (really not the best thing, though) and just talk to him nicely and tell him, and then, get in your house-and lock the door. Do it real smooth.\\nAnd hopefully that will be it. But sometimes…they drive around the block and knock on the door again. Do not answer.\\nSometimes, theae kind of “sweet” seeming guys have “crazy” under that facade. That’s why you go not want let yourself to be alone with them when you do this.\\nI’m not rying to scare you. You asked this question-and I just pulled up things that have happened to me in my long years of living. But remember that-I don’t care WHO he is. When you break up with a guy-NEVER do it when you two are all alone inside some place. NEVER. Because, not matter how sweet he seems, there can be a whole 180 flip.\\nTake care of yourself.

Although Rumi’s poetry belongs to Islamic/Persian culture, I should like to interpret it through a Christian lens from the perspective you requested i.e. love. This field is for me a symbol for Paradise, what Muslims call The Home in the Hereafter. It is a place where there is no conflict, no duality, no division where all souls co-exist in unity with each other and their maker, the Divine Essence. But how to get there? Rami sees love as one of the pathways to divine consciousness and understanding of the meaning/purpose of carnal existence. The Bible describes four kinds of love, what the Greeks call Agape, Storge, Phileo and Eros. Agape is divine love, the love that the creator has for the creatures made in his image; Storge is love of family; Phileo is the platonic feeling of connectedness one has with friends, acquaintances, and colleagues with whom one has a strong intellectual and personal rapport; and Eros is romantic love. The latter three help us to become less selfish and more connected with the other souls that constitute humanity. However, the main path to Paradise is becoming one with divine love i.e. selfishness in its purest, perfect form. This love is acquired through reading of the scriptures and practising the principles and lifestyle they espouse.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Frank Rizzo', 'question_title': 'What does the Rumi quote \"out beyond ideas Of wrongdoing and rightdoing, There is a field.

This is crazy talk! I used to talk to a guy. I literally met him at a tattoo shop, he was the piercer. I saw him, he was attractive in the way he asked questions. He seemed very caring which was attractive to me. So I decided I’d give it a shot.\\nThat night I am not kidding you, he sent me a very long paragraph through text saying how much I wowed him and how he had fallen for every word that I said and how I was so enticing to him. Cool that was nice of him to be so thoughtful and caring.\\nFew days later we go on a date. He’s keeping eye contact. The flow of the conversation just doesn’t stop at all. It was a nice date. That night he text me an even longer paragraph at how he’s positive I’m the one for him. That we need to get married and have a baby ASAP. That he is completely in love with me. So this here gives me a weird vibe already. How can you be in love with me when you barely know me?\\nSo one more shot. We go on another date and I told him I’m not completely ready for a relationship I’d just like to slow down and that I know he doesn’t love me, that we can continue talking and see where it goes. I go home and he texts me immediately a paragraph that his heart has shattered to pieces and why was I telling him I didn’t love him etc. I reassured him that I was only saying that I know he doesn’t love me and that it takes time to fall in love with someone and we will take that time if it works that way. He then starts to tell me that he’s dying of cancer and he’s not sure how long he will live. That it’s 6 months tops that we need to be in a relationship so that he can die happy with the woman he loves. I told him that I’d care about him and be there to talk to him but I was not going to get into a relationship when I’m not sure of how to even love myself yet. I’d just been recovering from 4 years of severe depression and a 2nd attempted suicide not too long before talking to him. I was not ready for a relationship AT ALL. Especially with someone that was throwing immediately red flags.\\nAnyways the point is, more often than not a confession of love with weeks of meeting someone is certainly a red flag to a healthy minded woman. I’ve rushed into tens of relationships that never worked because why? We did not take the time to fully get to know each other. I will tell everyone that asks me about loving their partner, It takes time.

It was very emotional and there’s was crying on both sides but we both reiterated that we still love and care deeply for each other and how important we are in each other’s life’s. He broke up with me saying that it was because he needs to do this in order to move forward and find out who he is and because he doesn’t want to hurt me anymore (even though I told him I never felt that he did). I feel like we had something special and our love was authentic. I also feel that this was partially my fault because I would make a big deal out of little things and because I had some trust issues from the past I told him about. This break up has been a real eye opener to me about how I acted inappropriately sometimes and I genuinely want to change myself for the better. After a long emotional talk about the break up we decided to end the bad day on a good note and we drove to get smoothies. He held my hand tight the whole time and took the long way back to my place. We gave each other one long last goodbye hug and a last kiss. We both cried and he assured me everything was going to be ok.

So, I don’t really believe in the stuff that I haven’t personally experienced or had a ton of proof for. Same was with the whole meant to be and soulmates stuff. I have always believed that for anything to work out in your favour you have to work extremely hard at it and consistently. Fate has nothing to do with it and it’s just an excuse lazy people make to not work stuff out. Even though 90% of this belief is very sustained today, I do believe now, that fate also has a role to play.\\nHere’s a little background.\\nIt’s November of 1988. I’m in the final leg of completing my Bachelors in Arts and I was a great student. Both my parents were professors of literature and it was a very obvious thing that they imbibed their love for literature in me and well. I too wanted to be a professor and my parents made me go to college in my vacation days with them so as to understand the work schedule and environment there. It was a mini internship, of sorts. This is where I met a shy man, a year elder to me and we bonded over our love for literature and how education is the only thing in the world that change the society we live in.\\nSoon, friendship transformed into love and before we knew it we had promised each other that we would be married to each other. Two blissful years passed like this. But here there was a big hitch. I am Hindu and he was a Christian. Even though intercaste and inter-religion marriages are frowned upon today, we see a pleasant change when it comes to the acceptance of these marriages. But back in 1990, it was a huge taboo. Just like “You-Know-The-One-Thing-That-Should-Not-Be-Talked_About”. My parents knew my boyfriend really well and liked him but they too had reservations but they eventually came around. I was so happy as 50% of the hurdle was passed. I was waiting for my boyfriend to tell him this wonderful news (Mobile phones were a luxury), but he never turned up. I couldn’t contact him for 2 days and I started fearing the worst. After two days, his neighbour came to my house with a letter from my boyfriend in which he had written that he was moving to Delhi permanently for job and that his family had fixed his marriage with someone from his church. I hadn't felt that much anger and devastation in my whole entire life. He had abandoned me and didn’t even have the courage to face me.\\nI was taunted by everyone: family, friends, colleagues and neighbours for loving someone from a different religion. I became the biggest joke and gossip. But through and through, my parents and my sister were my biggest support and honestly, they were the only people who helped me get over the overwhelming pain and hurt I was feeling. I had an amazing opportunity to work in Kolkata at that point, and my father in a heartbeat agreed to let me pursue it. This decision was again looked down upon as working women were considered a joke but a woman working away from home was a whole ball game altogether.\\nBut my dad stood my decision and I went off to Kolkata. Three years passed and I was 25 years old and then came the dooming question of my marriage. It was a huge deal and my parents were really worried. Still, they didn’t put any type of pressure on me and let me be. Around this time, I received the news that my ex-boyfriend had married and had moved on and this again opened some wounds which I thought were closed. For me, this was the final straw and although I was really wary of relationships and marriage in general, I couldn’t see my parents suffering and being the mole of all the taunts from the society after everything they had done for me in the past 3 years. To have that incredible support was my biggest blessing because usually in cases like mine, the girl is either labelled characterless and disowned by her own family.\\nI went to my father and said to him that I was ready to get married only if I was “allowed” to work. Things moved pretty fast after this and I was married within a year. My husband was a really nice man. He was kind and gentle and he knew everything about my history and never made it a case against me. We had a daughter within the next year and just like that five years of marriage just passed by. From the outside, I had the most perfect life. Good job, good married life and good health but I always felt something was missing\\nOne day I was going through some of my old stuff and I found a photo of me and ex-boyfriend with a single stem of marigold. And it happened so suddenly. All the memories came rushing back and I knew in that very second what was missing. I was never in love with my husband and he was at the least only a friend. And I had never stopped loving my ex-boyfriend.\\nI became more and more miserable with each passing day and I think my husband started noticing. One fine day he asked me what was wrong and I broke down completely and told him all the truth. It shattered him but nonetheless he said that if I wasn’t happy in the marriage, I shouldn’t be in it. We applied for mutual divorce and again it created a huge controversy. But my family and my ex-husband became my biggest support.\\nWe figured out a way to co-parent and had joint custody of our daughter. This was the year 1999 and divorces were a long and messy affair. I came back to stay at my parents' house for a few days. One evening I decided to take a walk down the street and ended up at a place which was a favourite of mine and my ex-boyfriend and voila! I see him sitting there, in our favourite spot, eating our all-time favourite order. Anger that was bottled up within me for the past one decade overcame me and I went to confront him. When I approached him, he was taken aback and just sat through all the screaming I did at him. Once I was finally done, told me everything that had happened. His family had threatened him that if he didn’t let go of me they would defame and also disown him. That is why he took the overnight decision to move to Delhi to live with his cousin so as to protect me and the reason he sent the letter through his neighbour was that he was the only one he could trust at that point of time. I told him that I didn’t believe him at all and he said that was fair. But what he said next blew my mind. He told me that he thought he was over me and that he was happy in his new life until he saw the same photo I had seen which made him realise he still loved me and I was taken aback. It also happened around the same time too. Soon after, he divorced his wife and he had come back to Mumbai. After this point on, there was no looking back.\\nWe picked up from where we had left off and everything slowly started falling in place. We got married in 2001 and had a son a year later. Recently, my daughter got married and she had her two dads walk her down the aisle.\\nWe were just meant to be and honestly, this is a magic work of fate :)\\nIf you are here till the end, thank you!\\nLeave a comment below if you liked my story and if it made you believe in your story too!\\nLove,\\nA.G\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 0, 'question_author': 'Anonymous', 'question_title': 'What is your meant-to-be love story?', 'no_of_view': '47', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

He very rarely shows his anger. I never take this as an advantage. I apologise to him if I am wrong. I don't hesitate to accept my mistakes.\\nHe appreciates my efforts, my cooking, my duties, I take towards his parents and our house.\\nHe is extremely modest. Also, likes to live a simple life.\\nHe sends a text when he misses me, perhaps a simple love/like the kind of message. Every marriage has up's and down's, we too had and sometimes misunderstandings do arise.\\nNever for once in 5 years of marital life, we have exchanged dirty pics and have had sex conversations or I had been forced for it.\\nHe says I was his and am the best friend forever.\\nHe works very hard for the family, sometimes, late nights, sometimes, 2 days at a stretch, his work keeps him very busy. He always thanks me for not nagging and disturbing him. Space is important for a good relationship.\\nHe stands for me when I have to juggle between inlaws and myself. At least, he thinks who is correct and who's not. (He has his brain and not a kid). If he wouldn't have supported, it was difficult for me to stay in this marriage for 5 years. For a happy marriage, the ere aren't just a husband and the wife but the husband and his entire family. You're not happy even if one of his family members is not good. Now, don't ask me, ‘why do you bother about others'? And, yes, I must bother because marriage is just not 2.\\nHe can't see my tears. He can't see me in pain.\\nHe asks me to rest as much as possible when is off from work and does all the household. It's difficult for me sometimes to manage during 6-the month pregnancy.\\nHe can never stop me thanking! For the understanding I have towards him, the responsibilities, I take, for the woman I am, for the brain and mind I have, for the thinking I have as same as him, for not pressurizing him to buy a house or any huge investment. I know he earns well but I do not want a house by taking hefty EMI's, instead, I want to save money. I don't believe in the concept of paying instalments and interests that's isn't affordable for me, at least. For instance, we own a house but life changed so much due to Corona, I do not have savings, what would we do? What would we eat? How would we pay the bills? How would he manage his parents? They are dependent on him for everything! I must think all these………. It's not easy for a middle-class family to buy a house and suffer in tougher times. Can't predict life.\\nHe respects me and my parents. He never taunts anyone not speaks of others beit his friends or anyone. He has a good nature.\\nHe has never for once complained against me to his parents. Initially, it was very difficult adjusting to the conservative and reserved family of his. My MIL is a tough person to handle.\\nHe accepts the differences we have. I am stubborn.\\nHe will never have an affair outside me, at least for this life I am his. He will and want to find some other in the next, he says \\U0001f923😀\\U0001f92a\\nSo, you know how sweet he is!\\nThe sweetness of a person is not measured by the trophies they gift but by the gestures that fill one's heart.\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 2, 'question_author': 'Aakash Ranjan [Sky]', 'question_title': 'How sweet is your husband?', 'no_of_view': '13,598', 'answer_count': 4}\n",

You don\\'t choose who to fall in love with. Love just happens.\\n[They were an ordinary pair caught in an ordinary world where convention means more than a meeting of souls]\\nI\\'LL NEVER FORGET YOU\\nby Ray Bradbury\\nFrom Mar 1983 Reader\\'s Digest (Pages 92-96)\\nWhen Ann Taylor came to teach at Green Town Central, it was the summer of her 24th birthday and it was the summer when Bob Spaulding would turn 14. She was that teacher for whom all the children wanted to bring huge oranges or pink flowers. She always seemed to be passing by on days when the shade was green under then tunnels of oaks and elms. She was the fine peaches of summer in the snow of winter, and she was cool milk for cereal on a hot early-June morning. And those rare few days in the year when the climate was balanced as fine as a leaf between winds that blew just right, those were the days like Ann Taylor, and should have been so named on the calendar.\\nAs for Bob Spaulding he was the cousin who walked alone through town on any October evening with a pack of leaves after him like a horde of Halloween mice. Or you would see him, like a slow white fish in the tart waters of the Fox Hill Creek, baking brown - or hear his voice in those treetops where the wind entertained, dropping down hand by hand, and there would come Bob Spaulding to sit alone and look at the world.\\nThat first morning when Miss Ann Taylor entered and wrote her name on the board, the schoolroom seemed suddenly flooded with illumination, as if the roof had moved back. Bob Spaulding sat with a spitball hidden in his hand, but let it drop. After class, he brought in a bucket of water and began to wash the boards. \"What\\'s this?\" She turned to him from her desk, where she had been correcting spelling papers.\\n\"The boards are kind of dirty. I suppose I should have asked permission,\" he said, halting uneasily.\\n\"I think we can pretend you did,\" she replied, smiling, and at this smile he finished the boards in a burst of speed and pounded the erasers so furiously that the air was full of snow, it seemed.\\nThe next morning he happened by the place where she took board and room just as she was coming out to walk to school.\\n\"Well, here I am,\" he said.\\n\"And do you know,\" she said, \"I\\'m not surprised.\"\\n\"May I carry your books?\" he asked.\\n\"Why, thank you, Bob.\"\\nThey walked for a few minutes and he said nothing. She glanced over and slightly down at him and saw how at ease he was, how happy he seemed. When they reached the edge of the school ground, he said, \"I better leave you here. The other kids wouldn\\'t understand.\"\\n\"I\\'m not sure I do, either,\" said Miss Taylor.\\n\"Why, we\\'re friends,\" said Bob with a natural honesty.\\n\\'Bob--\" she started to say. \"Never mind.\" She walked away.\\nAnd there he was in class and there he was after school for the next two weeks, never speaking, quietly washing the boards while she worked, and there was the silence of the sun going down in the slow sky, and the rustle of papers and the scratch of a pen. Sometimes the silence would go on until almost five, when Miss Taylor would find Bob in the last seat, waiting.\\n\"Well, it\\'s time to go home,\" Miss Taylor would say. And he would run and fetch her hat and coat. Then they would walk across the empty yard and talk all sorts of things.\\n\"What are you going to be, Bob, when you grow up?\"\\n\"A writer,\" he said.\\n\"Oh, that\\'s big ambition.\"\\n\"I know, but I\\'m going to try,\" he told her. \"I\\'ve read a lot.\"\\nHe thought for a while and said, \"Do me a favor, Miss Taylor?\"\\n\"It all depends.\"\\n\"I walk every Saturday along the creek to Lake Michigan. There\\'re a lof of butterflies and crayfish. Maybe you\\'d like to walk too.\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid not. I\\'m going to be busy.\"\\nHe started to ask doing what, but stopped. \"I take along sandwiches and pop. I wish you\\'d come.\"\\n\"Thanks, Bob, perhaps some other time.\"\\n\"I shouldn\\'t have asked you, should I?\" he said.\\n\"You have every right to ask anything you want to,\" she said.\\nA few days later she gave him a copy of Great Expectations. He stayed up all night reading it, and they talked about it.\\nEach day Bob met Miss Taylor and many days she would start to tell him not to come anymore, but she never could.\\nHe talked with her about Dickens and Kipling and Poe, coming and going to school. But she found it impossible to call on him to recite in class. She would hesitate, then call someone else. Nor would she look at him while they were walking. But on several late afternoons as he moved his arm high on the blackboard, sponging away the arithmetic symbols, she found herself glancing over at him for seconds at a time.\\nThen one Saturday morning he was standing in the creek with his overalls rolled up to his knees, bending to catch crayfish, when he looked up and saw her.\\n\"Well, here I am,\" she said, laughing.\\n\"And do you know,\" he said, \"I\\'m not surprised.\"\\n\"Show me the crayfish and the butterflies,\" she said.\\nThey walked down to the lake and sat on the sand with a warm wind blowing softly about them, fluttering her hair and the ruffle on her blouse, and he sat a few yards back from her and they ate the ham-and-pickle sandwiches and drank the orange pop solemnly.\\n\"I didn\\'t think I would ever come on a picnic like this,\" she said.\\n\"With some kid,\" he said.\\nThey said little else during the afternoon.\\n\"This is all wrong,\" Bob said later. \"And I can\\'t figure why. Just walking along and catching butterflies and crayfish and eating sandwiches. But Mom and Dad\\'d rib me if they knew, and the kids would too. And the other teachers would laugh at you, wouldn\\'t they?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid so. I don\\'t exactly understand how I came here at all,\" she said.\\nThat was about all there was to the meeting of Miss Ann Taylor and Bob Spaulding: two or three monarch butterflies, a copy of Dickens, a dozen crayfish, four sandwiches and two afternoon, she left early with a headache.\\nBut on Tuesday after school they were both in the silent room again - he sponging the board contentedly, and she working on her papers in peace, when suddenly the courthouse clock struck five. Its great bronze boom shuddered one\\'s body, making you seem older by the minute. Miss Taylor put down her pen.\\n\"Bob,\" she said, \"come here.\"\\n\"Yes\\'m.\" He put down the sponge.\\nShe looked at him intently for a moment until he looked away. \"Bob,\" I wonder if you know what I\\'m going to talk to you about.\"\\n\"Yes,\" he said at last. \"About us.\"\\n\"How old are you, Bob?\"\\n\"Going on fourteen.\"\\n\"Do you know how old I am?\"\\n\"Yes\\'m, I heard. Twenty-four. I\\'ll be twenty four in ten years, almost,\" he said. \"And sometimes I feel twenty-four.\"\\n\"Yes, and sometimes you almost act it.\"\\n\"Do I, really?!!\"\\n\"Now sit still. It\\'s very important that we understand what is happening. First, let\\'s admit we are the greatest friends in the world. I have never had a student like you, nor have I had as much affection for any boy I\\'ve ever known.\" He flushed at this. She went on. \"And let me speak for you - you\\'ve found me to be the nicest teacher of any you\\'ve ever known.\"\\n\"Oh, more than that,\" he said.\\n\"Perhaps more than that, but there are facts to be faced - a town and its people, and you and me. I\\'ve thought this over, Bob. Don\\'t think I\\'ve been unaware of my feelings. Under some circumstances our friendship would be odd. But you are no ordinary boy. And I know I\\'m not sick, mentally or physically, and that whatever has evolved here has been a true regard for your character and goodness. But those are not the things we consider in this world, unless they occur in a man of a certain age. I don\\'t know if I\\'m saying this right.\"\\n\"If I was ten years older and about fifteen inches taller it\\'d make all the difference,\" he said.\\n\"I know it seems foolish,\" she said. \"When you feel very grown-up and right and have nothing to be ashamed of. Maybe someday they will judge a person\\'s mind so accurately that they can say, \\'This is a man, though his body is only thirteen, with a man\\'s responsibility.\\' But until then, we have to go by ages and heights in an ordinary world.\"\\n\"I don\\'t like that,\" he said.\\n\"Perhaps I don\\'t either, but there really is no way to do anything about us.\"\\n\"Yes, I know.\"\\n\"We must decide what to do,\" she said. \"I can secure a transfer from this school ...\"\\n\"You don\\'t have to do that,\" he said. \"We\\'re moving. My folks and I, we\\'re going to live in Madison.\"\\n\"It has nothing to do with all this, has it?\"\\n\"No, no, my father has a new job there. It\\'s only fifty miles away. I can see you, can\\'t I?\"\\n\"Would that be a good idea?\"\\n\"No, I guess not,\" he said.\\nThey sat awhile in the silent schoolroom.\\n\"When did all this happen?\" he said, helplessly.\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" she said. \"Nobody ever knows. They haven\\'t known for thousand of years. Sometimes two people like each other who shouldn\\'t. I can\\'t explain it.\"\\n\"There\\'s one thing I want you to remember,\" she said finally. \"There are compensations in life. You don\\'t feel well now; neither do I. But something will happen to fix that. Do you believe that?\"\\n\"I\\'d like to. If only you\\'d wait for me,\" he blurted.\\n\"Ten years?\"\\n\"I\\'d be twenty-four then.\"\\n\"But I\\'d be thirty-four and another person entirely, perhaps. No, I don\\'t think it can be done.\"\\nHe sat there for a long time. \"I\\'ll never forget you,\" he said.\\n\"You\\'ll forget.\"\\n\"I\\'ll find a way of never forgetting you,\" he said.\\nShe went to erase the boards.\\n\"I\\'ll help you,\" he said.\\n\"No, no,\" she said hastily. \"You go home.\"\\nHe left the school. Looking back, he saw Miss Taylor through the window, at the board, slowly washing out the chalked words.\\nHE moved away the next week and was gone for 16 years. Though he was only 50 miles away, he never got to Green Town again until he was almost 30 and married. Then one spring they were driving through on their way to Chicago and stopped off for a day.\\nBob left his wife at the hotel and walked around town and finally asked about Miss Ann Taylor.\\n\"Oh, yes, the pretty teacher. She died in 1936, not long after you left.\"\\nHad she ever married?\\n\"No, come to think of it, she never had.\"\\nHe walked out to the cemetery and found her stone, which said, \"Ann Taylor, born 1910, died 1936.\" And he thought, Twenty-six years old. Why, I\\'m almost four years older than you are now, Miss Taylor.\"\\nLater in the day the people in the town saw Bob Spaulding\\'s wife strolling to meet him under the elms and the oak trees. She was the fine peaches of summer in the snow winter, and she was cool milk for cereal on a hot early-summer morning. And this was one of those rare few days in time when the climate was balanced like a leaf between winds that blow just right, one of those days that should have been named, everyone agreed, after Robert Spaulding\\'s wife.\"\\n- Condensed from \"A Story of Love\", a short story by Ray Bradbury.\\nWhat a beautiful love story indeed. Unconventional, unorthodox but precisely what love is all about - when two souls meet, transcending time, age, convention. Forbidden love? It depends on how you look at it.\\nHope you have enjoyed the story as much as I do. It tucked at my soul and opened the floodgate of emotions I had locked away for decades - it reminded me of my own Ms Ann Taylor, and yes, I will never forget them (I did have more than one Ms Ann Taylor).\\nGodspeed.\\nBest regards.

How could a woman take a risk with such a man, many women do but ends in tears, proving them such men are useless.\\nMen and boys, please learn some confidence, there is no risk-free life. If you are unable to make an effort out of your fear zone, to show a girl/woman that you are prepared to take risks for her and be a person who will stand with her as a proper man , I will ask myself, if anyone would date me for being scared. Such men cannot take any risks and cannot protect anyone because they bail themselves out seeking low risk.\\nA relationship takes effort from both sides; effort to take control and to pursue our needs and dreams. But if we would rather choose to remain stagnant due to fear (high/low risk), we will constrict a good relationship. This is the main reason for most relationships to fail eventually.\\nAt first, we are fearful to take a leap of faith to fulfil our needs and once we obtain something for free, rather than being grateful, we take that for granted (weak men). This has a cascading effect; hence we continue to resist change unable to be a better person to contribute to a loving relationship, allowing it to breathe and grow. The longer we are holding them back (our partners refusing to change with them, taking risks), resisting change, eventually it breaks free and you are the only loser left behind as a useless man.\\nNow ask yourself, do you want to own your fears and find your happiness rather than base your need on low/high risk, with this girl, and continue to be a better man taking many more risks with her for the rest of your life, as it should be.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Ben John Dover', 'question_title': 'Why is my mind telling me I should not risk it and forget about her, but my heart is telling me to wait?

Thanx to Doordarshan to broadcast this serial again.\\nSita never asked anything for himself. She always lived for others.\\nSita before her marriage used to do Gauri Puja for the fulfillment of her desires. Sita is seen everywhere as a symbol of blessing.\\nSita despite being the princess used to be involved in all household works including mopping and sweeping. One of the famous stories about it is One day while she was cleaning her house, she easily lifted the Vilshan Dhanush(Bow and arrow) of Lord Shiva. Her father, King Janak was shocked to see the kind of power Sita had and immediately started to prepare for her Swayamvar to choose an ideal husband for her.\\nSita as daughter had enthralled all. That is why, Sita’s mother had told Lord Rama that in the role of a daughter-in-law, her life will be full of grief. When she came to Rama’s house after marriage, she pleased everyone there as well. That's why Rama became very fond of her.\\nDuring Rajyaabhishek, Sita used to work full-time with Rama and assist in him in whatever he required.\\nSita used to do good care of her family that when it was decided about Rama’s exile, without even him uttering a word she understood his worry. She prepared him and herself for exile.\\nHappy Reading :)\"}}, 'no_of_follower': 2, 'question_author': 'Shalini Mishra', 'question_title': 'What are the qualities of \"Sita\" that you love?', 'no_of_view': '2,125', 'answer_count': 1}\n",

He was found unresponsive at 6:00 a.m on 3/20/2019. He made emergency calls to two friends he trusted at 3:00 a.m. Something serious was happening and he was calling for help somewhat incoherent. He was transported to a hospital less than a mile from his home . The two friends met him met and accompanied him to the hospital that had saved his life on more than one occasion in recent years. He was worked on and then placed on a ventilator in the ICU where he had successfully been cared for in the past. One of the friends contacted a senior family member who lives in the Chicago area. I live in the New Orleans area. Two sisters were on the next flight to New York. I was not contacted. He and I had become very close in the past 16 months. We were in love. He as 76 and had never married. Consequently, procrastinator that he was, he was taking his time inviting me to join him in Brooklyn. It was discussed in passing. We spoke almost daily for an hour or more at a time. If one didn’t place the call, the other would. I would nap in the evening and set my alarm for 11:05 p.m. to be awake and alert for the call. I he suffered from insomnia. I last spoke with him in the early morning hours of 3/19/201. My last words to him were good night, I love you a coupe of kisses and a “stay out of trouble” (he was Irish with a quick temper on occasion—-never with me. We never even exchanged angry words over President Trump whom I voted for and he hated with a passion.). I was had been busy and was physically tired on 3/19/2010. No call. I called him during the day on 3/20/2019. No answer. Sometimes he had problems with his iPhone. No call. On 3/21/2019 I began making calls determined to find him. No answer. I called the hospital I found him hospitalized in the ICU. I was surprisingly to me put on the phone with one of his sisters. I was advised that he was unconcerned and in dire condition. This had happened before and he was brought back to a functioning life. I called one of the two friends whom he called and were there with. He gave me sketchy information. He had not called me even though he knew of my relationship with Maurie. He was on my mind and in my prayers all day. I wasn’t home and able to call and inquire about his condition at which time I was advised that the had died 20 minimum earlier. They had told hospital to n plug his life support equipment. I couldn’t believe my ears. Dead. I was shocked, devasted and speechless. I received a 9 minute telephone call the next morning from one of the sisters telling me he was dead. I was told they would advise me about his funeral arrangements after they were made. It had been his desire and he had told me he had made arrangements to be buried in a cemetery on the campus of his beloved alma mater, the University of Notre Dame (he was heard utter the words “Go Irish” whenever he would encounter another alumni, the phrase is like code words to alert each other of this connection). Instead his body was returned to Chicago for his funeral and buried in the Irish section of a northwest suburban Catholic cemetery. I have spent the past year loving him still, missing him, wishing he wasn’t dead while realizing he “is in a better place, not sick or in pain if what our faith leads us to believe is true”. This doesn’t help with the hurt very much. In 3/2020 I had sufficiently recovered to the extent that I gathered the courage to try to find the second he called the morning that was the beginning of the end for him. She has worked for him ten months, cooking, cleaning, shopping for him taking and picking up his laundry from the Chinese laundry he used. She had made it possible for him to live his life independently as he fiercely desired to the end. His mobility was reduced due to age related health problems. I texted 3 numbers and sent a person who could be her a message through Facebook messenger. A couple of days ago I received a message from her. I had questions about his final days that only she could answer. She had been there and knew the rest of the story. First and foremost she told me he loved me very much and talked about me all the time (I was very surprised because when we talked he always kept his feelings under control, but on occasion has be open about his love for me). I have been unable to sleep and in tears since she described his final hours to me. I have no reason to doubt her words.? She stayed close by him in the ICU and heard a doctor pleading with a key family member to allow the hospital to keep him on the ventilator for 72 hours. He felt there would be a positive change. She also told me that he would react to her voice when she was talking to him. She didn’t think he was brain dead. She stayed with him when the ventilator and machines were turned off and held his hand. He fought for life, it wasn’t a peaceful death. The others deserted him, left him to die alone. She told me their were tears coming from his eyes as he died. He knew what was happening, couldn’t talk or get them to stop the process. He wanted to live. He was a fighter, I found out that his death was not quiet and peaceful. This knowledge has broken my heart, I would never have allowEd him to suffer but I was not consulted nor in a decision making position. After the telephone call I texted his brother with the information I had found out. I asked why couldn’t you have left him on the ventilator and life support for 72 fucking hours? My flood pressure and heart beats had risen. He immediately denied what I had told him had happened and was very angry at me. I shut my phone off and didn’t respond until the morning with a carefully worded text. I didn’t read his texts because I did not want to have a heart attack. I did see a few pertinent sentences one in which he told me to leave his family alone and never contact them again. I was able to send one more carefully worded text before the told me he was blocking me and to stop stalking his family. (They were a family of 6 brothers and 3 sisters. My significant other was the first of the siblings to die.) My significant other was the second in the family. He has an older sister whose mean spirited character defines the word BITCH. In another story I related on Quora (one of my first ventures at a writing on Quora) she is the one who accused me of being a gold digger (I know and knew nothing of his finances, I loved him for his character who he was he made me happy, smile and laugh—I wasn’t interested in someone else’s money). They had a serious argument over me and didn’t speak from January until 5 days before his death). The woman contacted me on messenger just after his death, her Facebook page is private but by her doing this it had anything she might post show up on my Facebook page. She openly snubbed me at his funeral while most the other siblings were civil to me. (I knew about each of them through my significant other talking about them, the rest of the family knew my late husband well as he and my significant other had been close friends high school thru college.). In August the sister asked Facebook friends for prayers for her daughter’s mother-in-law who was very ill similar to life threatening conditioned my late husband experienced. After a few days in a response to another post re the ill woman my name showed up and the sister realized it was me and reacted angrily. Hence, she no doubt told everyone that I was stalking her. She sent me a message on messenger telling me that she didn’t know me, didn’t want to know me and that I had no business following her Facebook page. My husband and her brother had been friends but that friendship ended long ago. She did not acknowledge that her brother and I had had a close relationship for a year and a half. I sent her a terse text before she blocked me. (You would think I was harassing her not just praying for someone at her general request.). I did notice and point out to the brother in the most recent texting before I was blocked that this woman (no I did not refer to her as a bitch) who offended my significant other a year earlier by going behind his back to ask his primary care provider about his health without his permission. This was upsetting for him. (He was very discreet). I called the brother’s attention without response that this sister was posting on Facebook as sling for prayer for the daughter’s mother-in-law but not one asked for emergency prayers for my significant other ever. I noticed and found it strange. When my significant other died she did post about that. Writing about this very painful subject on a public forum has been cathartic for me. Made me feel better. I have not mentioned names or anything particularly identifying. I don’t believe any of the people Involved follow Quora or would recognize themselves. As they say, there are two sides to every story and this is my hurtful story from my point of view. I have considered deleting this story, I don’t even know if it will be posted and read by anyone.'}}, 'no_of_follower': 1, 'question_author': 'Carol Ward', 'question_title': 'What time did your loved one die and where?', 'no_of_view': '1,217', 'answer_count': 3}\n",
